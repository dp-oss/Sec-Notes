# Incident Response Planning
## Exercise
Test organization before actual event
- rules of engagement: what is the scope of the Exercise
- practice a specific scenario 
- evaluate the response 
    - document and discuss 
### Table top Exercises
Talking through a drill but not physically going througha disaster  or drill 
- simulated disaster 
### Walkthrough 
All responders actually go through each step of Incident-Response
- can identify faults or missing steps
### Simulation 
Testing with a simulated event
- phishing attack
    - phishing emails are sent to actual users to see who clicks
    - test internal phishing filters 
    - can indicate who needs more security training 

## Stakeholder management
Maintaining a relationship with customers of IT
- needs to be ongoing before incidents 
    - ongoing communication 
    - exercises should include customers 

## Communication Plan
- Make sure to have a contact list 
    - Corporate and organization
        - CISO 
        - IR teams 
        - Non-IT personnel
            - HR
            - PR 
            - Legal
        - Maybe even legal
            - law enforcement 


## Disaster Recovery Plan
If a disaster occurs IT needs to be ready
- disasters can be natural but also man made
    - ex. construction incidents
- A comprehensive recovery plan needs to be made
    - recovery location
    - data recovery 
    - application restoration
    - employee availability
- also see: [[Site Resiliency]]
### Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) 
A plan on what needs to be done if our normal technology is not in place 
- we need to have alternatives to current technology 
- these need to be documented and tested before disasters occur

## Incident Response Team
Predifined group of professionals that handles incidents
- may not be a permanent role but rather an additional responsibility 
- can be outsourced 

## Retention Policies 
How data is stored and backed up
- Where is the data located
- copies, versions? 
- old data may need to be purged
- Regulations may force data to be kept for a certain period of time 
- Operational needs
    - accidental deletion
    - disaster recovery
- differentiate by type and application
    - recover the most important data first
