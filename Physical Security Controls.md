**Barricades / bollards**: 
Prevent access to an an area by blocking it off
- typically to stop vehicles 
- cones, moats, concrete, moats 

**Access control Vestibules**: A set of doors requiring an unlocking procedure to prevent unauthorized access
- Control access to specific groups or people 
- often use keycards or pin authentication 
- can require multiple checks 

**Alarms**: A circuit based security measure that trips making loud noises and drawing attention
- can be on opening a door
- motion detected 

**Signs**: Clear instructions providing information about an area
- safety
- access
- danger 
- Fire exits 
- chemicals 
- hard hat 
- medical resources 
- 

**Video surveillance**: 
- CCTV (Closed circuit television)
- can detect motion
- can help identify faces / licsense plate

**Industrial Camouflage**: Concealing important buildings making them look like generic industrial buildings 

**Guards and access lists**: 
- can be used to provide guest access
- often requires ID badges
- security can enforce the access list 
- maintains a log of visitors 
- Two-person integrity/control
	- employ multiple guards to ensure no single person has physical access to an asset 


**[[Biometric Authentication|Biometrics:]]** Authentication using a physical aspect of an employees body

**Door access**:
- conventional 
	- lock and key 
- deadbolt
- electronic
	- key phob
	- pin 
- Token-based
	- badge 
	- swipe card
- can be multi factor 

**Cable locks**: Temporary security measure preventing a piece of hardware from being taken or moved 
- most devices have pre made connectors for this device 
- not intended for long term protection 
- like a bike lock 

**USB data blocker**: device allowing voltage over USB but not data transfer 
- used to prevent [[Juice Jacking]]

**Lighting**: 
Good lighting allow cameras to get a clearer picture and thwart attackers looking to stay anonymous
- consider shadows when attempting facial recognition

**Fences**: 
A perimeter around important facilities 
- Obvious that you have something to protect 
- Can be see through or opaque
- Prevent climbing with barbed wire 

**Fire Suppression**: 
Preparing to prevent fires in an emergency

**Sensors**: 
Detect and provide information about a monitored area
- motion
- noise 
- proximity
	- often used with locking doors
- moisture 
	- to identify leaks that can damage hardware 
- Temperature
	- monitor changes overtime 


**[[Embedded Systems#^30bd1b|Drones]]**: Quickly survey large areas 


**Faraday Cage**: 
A mesh of conductive materal preventing radio signals from passing through
- cannot block all types 
- can restrict mobile networks
	- plan for people to be able to call in an emergency 
**Screened Subnet**:
A separate physical network for the public to access specific services 
- prevents access to internal resources 
- also known as DMZ

**Protect distribution:** 
PDS protected distribution systems physically secure a cabled network
- prevents tapping 
- prevents physical DoS
