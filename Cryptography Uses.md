**Low Power devices**: 
- have limited compute
- use smaller symmetric key size
- [[Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography#^0be8c2|ECC]] is used for asymmetric 
To reduce latency [[Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography#^3010f5|symmetric]] with smaller key sizes is used 


**Confidentiality**: 
Encrypting information can keep it secret and private

**Integrity**: 
Hashes can allow data to be verified 

**Obfuscation**: 
Encryption can be used to hide the contents of data 
- common tactic of malware to avoid signature detection 

**[[Methods of Authentication|Authentication]]**: 
[[Hashing and Digital Signatures|Hashes]] are used to confirm passwords without having them stored in plain text 

**Non-repudiation**: 
[[Hashing and Digital Signatures#^d2510e|Digital signatures]] can be used to confirm authenticity of data and ensure you know the sender
