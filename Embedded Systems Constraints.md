Embedded systems are not a fully capable computer, they're built for a single purpose and at a lower cost 

- limited features 
- hard to upgrade 
- few options for communicate 
- Power:
	- may not access main power source 
	- Batteries may need replacement
- Compute:
	- lower power CPUs limit speed
	- though they may produce less heat
- Network:
	- May not be able to wire due to hardware or geographic limits 
	- Wireless can also limit bandwidth 
- Crypto:
	- Weak CPUs make encryption difficult 
- Can be difficult to patch or install new firmware 
- Authentication
	- limits on compute make secure authentication a challenge 
- Range: 
	- additional functionality beyond the intended use is likely not possible
- Cost:
	- Will be cheaper since its purpose built
	- this can affect quality though 
- Trust:
	- limited hardware/software access makes security audits hard
