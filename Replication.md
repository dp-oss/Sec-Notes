**SAN (Storage area network) replication**: 
SANs are high performance networks of storage drives 
- Data is stored in specialized networks away from applications
	- If one device fails you can still access the data 
		- this decreases recovery times
- Keeping duplicates of SANs allows you to create redundancy and increase data accessibility in the even of a failure 
- SAN snapshots create a backup of the SANs at a dedicated interval 

**VM replication:** 
- Creating redundancy in virtual machines by creating copies 
	- allows for recovery if something goes wrong
	- changes can be rolled out to all copies 
### On Prem vs cloud redundancy:
**On prem**: 
- Pros: 
	- speedier than cloud 
	- security in your hands
- Cons:
	- Cost
- 


*Cloud data and backups need to be encrypted*
