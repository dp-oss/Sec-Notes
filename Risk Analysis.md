# Risk Analysis

## Evaluating Risk
- Risk register
    - identify and document risks assosciated with each step of project
    - apply solutions
    - monitor results
- Risk matrix/heatmap
    - view results of assessment
    - risk severity is based on color in the heat map
    - risk liklihood based on heatmap colors as well

## Audit risk model
- Inherent Risk
    - Impact + liklihood
    - risk taht exists in the absence of controls
    - some models include existing controls
- Residualt risk
    - Inherent risk + control effectiveness
    - risk that exists after controls
- Risk Appetite
    - ammount of risk org is willing to take

## Risk control assessment 
Risk has been determined
    - heatmaps created
- Time to build cybersecurity requirements
- find gaps using an audit
- build and maintain security sytesms based on risk requirements
- determine if existing controls are compliant or non-compliant
    - make plans to bring everything to compliance

## Risk Awareness
IT security is a constantly changin enviornment
- new risk
- emerging risks
- knowledge is key
    - everyone needs to be aware of new risks
    - part of onboarding for employees and partners
- Maintain awareness
    - ongoing training
    - group discussions
    - security conferences and programs 

## Regulations affecting risk posture
- Regulations directly assosciated with cybersecurity
    - protect personal or financial info
    - requires for minimum security
- HIPPA - health insurance portability and accountability act
    - patient privacy
    - storage requirements 
    - network security
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
- see: [[1712339015-ZZPA|Security Regulations and Standards]]

## Qualitative Risk Assessment
identify and categorize significant risk factors without basing on specific values
- display visually 
    - heatmaps
    - traffic light grid

## Quantitative Risk Assessment
categorize risk based on specific determined values
- Liklihod:
    - Anualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
        - how likely will it occur each year
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
    - how much will you lose if the risk occurs one time
- ALE (Anualized Loss Expectancy)
    - ARO x SLE
- Business impact can be more than monetary
    - Quantitative vs Qualitative 

## Disaster Types
- enviornmental 
    - weather 
- Person-made threats
    - human intent 
    - negligence 
    - error
    - crime 
    - fire
- Internal or external
    - internal can be from employees
    - external is outside the organization
