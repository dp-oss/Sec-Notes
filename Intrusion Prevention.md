[[Intrusion Prevention]]
**NIDS and NIPS**: Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
- watch network traffic to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited 
- Detection: Alarm or alert to intrusions 
- Prevention: stop intrusion before it gets into the network

**Passive monitoring**: examine a copy of traffic
- unable to block or prevent traffic 
- sometimes called Port mirror or [[Secure Networking#^d54fcc|software tap]]


**out of band response**: if IPS detects maliscious traffic responses back to the traffic can be stopped after the fact limiting the scope of the attack 


**Inline monitoring**: IPS/IDS sits physically inline of traffic 
- malicious traffic is immediately dropped 


**Identification methods**: 
- malicious signatures 
- anomaly (abnormal activity)
- behavior based 
- Heuristics
	- using big data and AI/ML to identify malicious software
