# Security Frameworks
Best practices and steps for securing data/systems. Securing is often a complex problem, Frameworks guide us in creating a program for security. 

## Center for Internet Security (CIS)
### Critical Security Controls for Effectivce Cyber Defense (CIS CSC) 
- Improve cyber defenses
- 20 key actions 
- designed to be implemented
- written by IT professionals 

## NIST RMF 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
- mandatory for US federal agencies 
- Six steps: 
    1. Categorize - define enviornment
    2. Select - Pick controls
    3. Implement - define proper implementation
    4. Assess - determine if controls work
    5. Authorize - make a decision to Authorize a system
    6. Monitor - Check for ongoing compliance

## NIST CSF 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Framework Core
    - identify 
    - protect 
    - detect 
    - respond 
    - recover 
- implementation Tiers
    - organization's view of risk and process to manage risk
- Framework profile
    - alignment of standards
    - guidlines 
    - practices 
    - to adhere to Framework core
- Designed for business 

## ISO/IEC Frameworks
International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Comission
- ISO/IEC 27001 
    - standard for Information Security Management System (ISMS) 
- ISO/IEC 27002
    - Code of practice for information security controls 
- ISO/IEC 27701 
    - Privacy Information Management Systems (PIMS) - ISO 31000
    - International standards for risk management practices 
- all international standards

## SSAE SOC 2 Type1/2
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standard for auidits
- SOC 2 - Trust Services Criteria (Security Controls)
    - firewalls
    - IDS
    - MFA 
- Type 1 audit
    - Tests controls in place at one time
- Type 2 audit
    - tests controls over a period of at least 6 consecutive months 
- we sees these audits occur for large organisations 
## Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) 
Cloud Security 
- Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
    - cloud specific controls 
    - standards 
    - best practices 
    - regulations 
- Enterprise Architecture:
    - methodology/tools 
    - assess internal IT groups and cloud providers
    - security capabilities 
    - build a roadmap
