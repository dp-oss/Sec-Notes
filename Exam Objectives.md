## 1.0 Threats, attacks and Vulnerabilities
### 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques
- Phishing:
    - Social engineering attack where the threat actor posing as something benign manipulates the target to take a certain action
- Smishing:
    - Phishing over SMS 
- Vishing: 
    - voice Phishing usually over the phone 
- Spam: 
    - Unsolicited messaging sent to users, not necessariliy mailicious but cetrainly can be
- Spam over instant messaging (SPIM)
    - spam sent through SMS or other messengers 
- Spear Phishing: 
    - Targeted phishing attacks usually aimed at higher up people in an organization 
- Dumpster Diving: 
    - digging through garbage or anything discarded to find out more information on a target 
- Shoulder Surfing: 
    - Finding out information by looking over someone's shoulder and looking at their screen 
- Pharming: 
    - creating a fake version of a real website to harvest credentials usually sent through phishing
- Tailgating: 
    - entering a secure area without authorization by following somebody inside 
- Eliciting information: 
    - getting a victim to give you information without realizing 
- Whaling: 
    - Phishing that targets a specific high up individual such as the ceo 
- Prepending:   
    - inserting malicious code or characters at the begining of an otherwise benign piece of software or command 
- Identity Fraud: 
    - Using someone's Personal information to benefit yourself 
- Invoice Scams:
    - Sending a fake bill to a company to try and get them to pay it
- Credential Harvesting: 
    - taking login credentials to access services without authorization
- Reconnaissance:
    - finding out information about a target, frequently done before pen testing but can also be done by attackers
- Hoax: 
    - a fake event used in social engineering to get people to act without thinking
- Impersonation:
    - social engineering technique where you pretend to be someone else 
- Watering Hole attack:
    - compromising a resource usually a website that is outside of a target but frequently used by the target in order to gain access to the target itself 
- Typosquatting: 
    - registering domains that are similar to the domain a user would want to go to in order to carry out malicious activities such as credential harvesting
- Pretexting
    - adding additional context to a conversation to make lies more convincing
- Influence Campaigns:
    - a targeted exrcise used to manipulate peoples thinking
    - Hybrid Warfare: 
        - warefare involving means other than kinetic, such as political, cyber, etc.
    - Social media:
        - influence campaigns using public social media platforms can be wide reaching 
- **Principles(Reasons for Effectiveness)**
    - Authority:
        - convincing social engineering target that you have authority over them to encourage certain action
    - Intimidation: 
        - technique to scare a target into action
    - Consensus: 
        - convincing target that others agree with the actions you want them to take 
    - Scarcity: 
        - convincing someone to act quickly something finite is going to run out 
    - Trust: 
        - convincing target that you are trustworthyin order to encourage the action 
    - Urgency: 
        - convincing target that the action needs to be taken as soon as possible to prevent them from analyzing the request

### Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack
- **Malware**: 
    - malicious software, not installed intentionally
    - Trojans: 
        - malware prentending to be something else 
    - Worms:
        - malware that can propogate itself and spread to other machines 
    - Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs): 
        - software not installed intentionally could be benign or malicious 
    - Fileless virus: 
        - a virus that never installs itself on your machine 
    - Command and control: 
        - server used to control infected machines known as bots somtimes called a C2 
    - Bots: 
        - infected computers that can be controlled by an attacker
    - Cryptomalware: 
        - malware that uses cryptography to encrypt user data making it unreadable 
    - Logic bombs: 
        - software or scripts that execute when specified conditions are met such as at a certain time
    - Spyware: 
        - malware that is designed to steal user data
    - Keyloggers:
        - software that captures users keystrokes, usually to steal credentials and spy 
    - Remote Access Trojan(RAT): 
        - malware designed to look benign but actually provides the attacker with remote control over a users system
    - Rootkit: 
        - malware that hides itself in low level operating system files to avoid detection, can be hard to find 
    - Backdoor: 
        - an opening in a piece of software intentially left to provide access to those who know about it, can be left by the dev or an attacker
- **Password attacks**:
    - attacks designed to break find out a password
    - Dictionary:
        - a password attack that uses a long word list trying every single one to see if it's the password
    - Bruteforce: 
        - Password attack that tries every single password possible to guess the password
        - Offline: 
            - offline bruteforce uses the hashed passwords and compares hashes of every possible password against the known password's hash
        - Online: 
            - sometimes known as spraying trying every possible password to authenticate directly with the service 
    - Rainbow table: 
        - a premade list of common passwords along with their hashes to compare directly with the hashed password 
    - Plaintext/unencrypted:
        - passwords typically are stored in a hashed format, unhashed or plaintext password storage is unsafe because if compromised the attacker has the exact password needed to authenticate 
- **Physical attacks**: 
    - malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable:
        - USB cable designed to look benign but actually steals data from the connected device 
    - malicious flash drive:
        - flash drive that appears to be benign but actually can infect or execute commands on a system
    - Card cloning:
        - taking stolen card information and writing it to another card to be used by the attacker 
    - Skimming: 
        - devices planted on card readers to steal information off of cards to be cloned later
- **Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:
    - Tainted training data for machine learning (ML):
        - malicious data added to a training set to have the machine learning model behave in unexpected ways
    - Security of machine learning algorithms:
        - ensure all data going into the machine is legitimate, frequently re-train to test new data
- **Supply chain attacks**:
    - attacking somewhere in the process that it takes to create a product or provide a service to infect a target down the line
- **Cloud based vs on premises attacks**:
    - Cloud computing solutions are more exposed because they're accessed over the internet, on-premises solutions require you to be responsible for the physical security of your devices. Changes can be rolled out more quickly in the cloud but take time on premises
- **Cryptographic Attacks**:
    - Birthday:
        - When you have 30 people in a room the liklihood that two share a birthday is 70%, a birthday attack compares all common values to find hash collisions 
    - Collision:
        - every value that is hashed should have a unique message digest, a collision is when two different values share the same message digest
    - Downgrade:
        - Convincing one side of a conversation to use less secure cryptography
### Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks
- **Privelege Escalation**: 
    - attacks that aim to increase the level of access the attacker has to a system, after initial breach
- **Cross-site Scripting**:
    - Attacks using malicious scripts in a victims browser to steal information such as tokens from other webpages
- **Injections**:
    - attacks that use an input field to execute code onthe target website or application
    - Structured query Language (SQL):
        - injecting an sql query into an input field to get information from a database
        - inputting: "105 OR 1=1" into the input field would execute the SQL query: ``SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;``
    - Dynamic-link library (DLL):
        - DLLs are libraries used in Windows, injecting a DLL into a different application can allow for the functions from that library to be run with the Privelege of the other application 
    - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP):
        - LDAP is used to access resources on a network,injecting LDAP queries can be used to return files that the user may not be authorized to access
    - Extensible Markup Language(XML):
        - XML is used to transfer and store data, injecting malicious XML can be used to allow access to unauthorized data
- **Pointer/object Dereference**:
    - an attack that forces an application to point to an area of memory where nothing exists, causing the application to crash
- **Direcroty Traversal**:
    - Changing the address of a website to request otherareas of the server that you may not be able to access
- **Buffer Overflow**:
    - Causing an application to write to much data to an area of memory, resulting in the data to spill over to other areas and cause unexpected behaviors 
- **Race Conditions**:
    - when multiple things occur at the same time applications can behave unexpectedly which attackers can use to their advantage
    - Time of check/time of use (TOCTOU):
        - making changes to something an application may need after it is checked by the app but before it is used, causing the app to behave unexpectedly 
- **Error Handling**:
    - application error messages can be too verbose and provide an attacker with too much information
    - applications need to properly handle errors as not to give an attacker more access in the event of an error
- **Improper Input Handling**:
    - input that is not sanitized or normalized in an application can be used to inject code into the data stream (injection attack) or cause other unexpected behaviors
- **Replay Attack**:
    - when an attacker captures a users traffic and sends it on to the server to appear that it's coming from the user
    - Session Replays:
        -
