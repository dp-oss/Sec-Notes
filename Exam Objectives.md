    - Keyloggers:
        - software that captures users keystrokes, usually to steal credentials and spy 
    - Remote Access Trojan(RAT): 
        - malware designed to look benign but actually provides the attacker with remote control over a users system
    - Rootkit: 
        - malware that hides itself in low level operating system files to avoid detection, can be hard to find 
    - Backdoor: 
        - an opening in a piece of software intentially left to provide access to those who know about it, can be left by the dev or an attacker
- **Password attacks**:
    - attacks designed to break find out a password
    - Dictionary:
        - a password attack that uses a long word list trying every single one to see if it's the password
    - Bruteforce: 
        - Password attack that tries every single password possible to guess the password
        - Offline: 
            - offline bruteforce uses the hashed passwords and compares hashes of every possible password against the known password's hash
        - Online:

    - Structured query Language (SQL):
        - injecting an sql query into an input field to get information from a database
        - inputting: "105 OR 1=1" into the input field would execute the SQL query: ``SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;``
    - Dynamic-link library (DLL):
        - DLLs are libraries used in Windows, injecting a DLL into a different application can allow for the functions from that library to be run with the Privelege of the other application

    - Time of check/time of use (TOCTOU):
        - making changes to something an application may need after it is checked by the app but before it is used, causing the app to behave unexpectedly 
- **Error Handling**:
    - application error messages can be too verbose and provide an attacker with too much information
    - applications need to properly handle errors as not to give an attacker more access in the event of an error
- **Improper Input Handling**:

- **Replay Attack**:
    - when an attacker captures a users traffic and sends it on to the server to appear that it's coming from the user
    - Session Replays:
        - using an active session ID to pose as a user

- **Resource Exhaustion**:
    - Denial of Service (DOS) attack that uses an application to use up all of the computing resources causing the target to become unresponsive
- **Memory Leak**:
    - When an application doesn't free up unused memory the memory of the system is continually used up until it's no longer usable
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping**: 
    - on path attack where the attacker sits in the middle of a conversation between a victim and a web server, forcing the victim to communicate with them in the clear and then encrypting the traffic and sending it to the web server. This way it looks to the user that the server is communicating unencrypted and to the server that the user is using encryption
- **Driver Manipulation**:
    - drivers are what's used to communicate with a computer's hardware, manipulating drivers can allow attackers to exploit portions of the system or operating system
    - Shimming:
        - adding extra code into operating system shims or areas where information is stored between OS components to run the codewithout detection  
    - Refactoring:
        - manipulating the driver in a way that it still appears to behave the same on the users end but actually has hidden malicious functions

        - specific methods, and behaviors that a certain threat will exhibit. allowing you to recognize what threat actor is targeting you
### 1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities
- **Cloud-based vs. on-premises vulnerabilities**:
    - When in a cloud enviornment you are trusting the physical security of your sytem with a third party, this can be beneficial if you trust the organization and they are larger than your own
    - Cloud enviornments can be more exposed because they're accessed via the internet whereas on premises systems can be segmented from the public internet more easily
- **Zero-day**:
    - a vulnerability that has not been seen in the wild, and thus cannot be patched by the vendor. It has been known about publicly for zero days when discovered or used for the first time
- **Weak configurations**:
    - Open Permissions:
        - if your permissions are left too open then low level accounts can access data and resources that should be only availible to higher level users
    - Unsecure root accounts:
        - if the root accounts are not secured propely attackers will have an easier time bypassing authentication and gaining privileged access to your systems 
    - Errors:
        - If errors are left unchecked in your configurations attackers can bypass security controls 
    - Weak Encryption:
        - weak encryption is vulnerable to bruteforce attacks or can be bypassed by some error in its implementation, this will allow to access whatever the encryption was protecting 
    - Unsecure Protocols:
        - if unsecure protocols are used within the organization they're vulnerable to exploitation and are not an effective security control 
    - Default settings:
        - default settings are known publicly and thus the gaps in their security are already known to attackers, this is an easy first place to look 
    - Open ports and services:
        - opening ports and services beyond what is strictly necessary introduces unwanted vulnerabilities into your systems 
- **Third Party Risks**:
    - Vendor management:
        - System Integration:
            - Third party access to internal systems needs to have proper security controls applied, for authentication, permissions etc. 
        - Lack of Vendor Support:
            - lacking vendor support can leave hardware and software out of date and insecure
            - making sure that vendors are aware of issues and capable of fixing them in a timely manner 
    - Supply Chain:
        - The chain of vendors that it takes to bring a product or service to production can introduce many vulnerabilities
        - it's important to verify your vendors, and verify where their materials are coming from 
        - it's possible for vulnerabilities to be introduced up the chain to a part where your organization has no control 
    - Outsourced code development:
        - If development of applications is occuring outside of your organization it is important to vet third party development security 
        - this can include the location of the source code. If the development is done by a third party but the code is stored in house than you'd need to ensure secure access of the code
    - Data storage
        - if data generated by your organization is held by a third party it's important to assess the security posture of the storage locations to ensure the data is accessible and in safe hands
        - this should be agreed upon before entering a partnership with a third-party
- **Improper or weak patch management**:
    - Firmware:
        - Firmware is run at a hardware level and necessary for adevice to function
        - often times firmware patches cannot be applied automatically over the air and need to be updated manually
        - this is often a problem for IOT devices who may not receive frequent firmware updates and thus can remain vulnerable 
    - Operating System (OS):
        - Operating System updates can often be applied automatically and over the air
        - it's important to test updates before rolling them out to all machines to ensure they'll continue to function properly
        - OS updates can contain security patches that close OS level vulnerabilities and thus should be made a priorty when they're released
    - Applications:
        - Application specific updates can typically be set to automatically apply
        - These updates can add new features and functions but also can increase the security of the application 
        - it's important to test these updates to ensure that they won't hinder the applicationsn functionality 
- **Legacy Platforms**:
    - legacy platforms are no longer supported by their developers
    - this can mean no more security patches or vendor support
    - legacy software may use outdated encryption or protocols that are no longer in use
- **Impacts**:
    - Dataloss:
        - The loss of data that is valuable to the organization can result from the failure or exploitation of systems 
    - Data Breaches:
        - leaking sensitive data to the public 
    - Data exfiltration:
        - data leaving the control of the organization without necessariliy being lost
        - can be leaked in a breach later
        - can contain IP or trad secrets
    - Identity theft:
        - if personal information is leaked in a breach it can be used to commit fraud and result in the customer's Identity being stolen 
    - Financial:
        - Organizations can be exploited financially by threat actors, through things like ransomware, or directly through theft, and through loss of potential sales
    - Reputation:
        - Falling victim to an attack can lead to a loss of reputation for an organization and decrease the trust consumers will have in the future, this can also influence stock prices if the company is traded publicly 
    - Availibility Loss:
        - if an attack rendors users unable to access their services a company can lose profits, reputation, etc.
### 1.7 Summarize the techniques used in security assessments 
- **Threat Hunting**:
    - Intelligence Fusion:
        - Aggregating intelligence from multiple sources and using tools to analyze trends in the data 
    - Threat feeds:
        - active advisements of the current threat landscape, what attackers are out there and what vulnerabilities they're exploiting
    - Advisories and bulletins:
        - Urgent security updates delivered in a standard place
    - Maneuver:
        - taking action to avoid security concerns 
- **Vulnerability Scans**:
    - False positives:
        - Something marked as a vulnerability to be investigated, but actually is benign
    - False Negatives:
        - Something marked as being safe that is actually a vulnerability
    - Log Reviews:
        - reviwing log reporting to locate threats 
    - Credentialed vs Non-credentialed:
        - scanning from the point of view of someone who doesn't have internal accecss to the network is Non-credentialed
        - scanning from inside the netwrok is Credentialed
    - Intrusive vs Non-intrusive:
        - Scans that only look to see what's open on the network without affecting operation is called Non-intrusive
        - something that has the potential to dirsupt operations would be konwn as intrusive like a penetration test
    - Application:
        - A vulnerability scan within the scope of a single application
    - Web Application:
        - vulnerability scan within the scope of an active web application
    - Network:
        - Vulnerability scan within the scope of an entire network, will include things like what ports are open and what services are running on those ports
    - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
        - CVE is the most popular database of vulnerabilities that have been reported this is run by the MITRE coorperation
        - CVSS is the scoring system used to rank vulnerabilitiesbased on severity, this rating is given from 0 being least severeto 10 being most severe
- **Syslog/Security Information Event Management (SIEM)**: 
    - Syslog:
        - standard for sending log files to a SIEM
    - SIEM:
        - a single database that aggregates security data to be analyzed
    - Review Reports:
        - Its important to review all security reports to determine if there is a vulnerability or an active threat 
    - Packet Capture:
        - Network Packets can be captured and sent to the SIEM to be analyzed 
    - Data Inputs:
        - sources of data that can be sent to a SIEM 
    - User Behavior Analysis:
        - It's important to analyze user behavior to find changes to patterns that can indicate an attack on that user's account 
    - Security Monitoring:
        - people in a SOC will monitor SIEMs for security events to be able to respond to events as they occur
    - Log Aggregation:
        - Inputting data from all different system logs to analyze in the SIEM, an essential function of a SIEM 
    - Log Collectors:
        - A part of the SIEM that waits for syslog messages to input data 
- **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**:
    - Orchestration:
        - Managing many devices in a unified way
    - Automation:
        - Setting up systems to respond to events themselves
    - Response:
        - through the use of Orchestration and Automation we can respond to Security events quickly and at machine speed
### 1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing 
- **Penetration Testing**:
    - A pen tester attempts to break into systems to
 learn about their vulnerabilities
    - Known Enviornment:
        - When the pen tester is given information about the systems before going into the test
    - Unknown enviornment:
        - when the pen tester is given no information prior to the penetration test and approaches it as an outsider
    - Partially known enviornment:
        - when the pen tester is given partial information before conducting the pen test, this simulates someone who may have a little information about the system such as an insider 
    - Rules of engagement:
        - the scope of the penetration test, what is the pen tester allowed to attempt to break into
    - Lateral Movement:
        - Moving from one device to another inside of the enviornment
    - Privilege Escalation:
        - Increasing ones access to a system from a position of lower access
    - Persistence:
        - The ability of a threat to remain on a system 
    - Cleanup:
        - Returning everything in the enviornment to its normal state afte a pentest
    - Bug bounty:
        - Companies will offer bug bounties to the public to penetration test specific portions of their service, this is a reward for finding vulnerabilities or bugs
    - Pivoting:
        - Using a system as a jumping off point to gain access to other systems 
**Passive and active Reconnaissance**:
    - Passive Reconnaissance:
        - Gaining information about a target wihtout alerting them to your presence
    - Active Reconnaissance:
        - Gaining information about a target in a way that may let the target know they're being scoped out
    - Drones:
        - Small remotely manned aircraft equiped with cameras and sensors to collect information from a birds eye view
    - War Flying:
        - Using a drone to map SSIDs of wireless networks from above
    - War Driving:
        - driving around and scanning SSIDs to map out wireless networks in an area
    - Footprinting:
        - Developing an understanding of what devices exist on a network 
    - OSINT:
        - Open source intelligence, gathering information from publicly availible sources 
- **Exercise Types**:
    - Red-team:
        - The attacker in a simulated scenario, they look for vulnerabilities in an organization
    - Blue-team:
        - the defender in a simulated scenario, they try to secure the assests and defend them from attack
    - White-team:
        - Manages both teams, determines what was learned from an exercise
    - Purple-team:
        - preforms actions both attacking and defending, if they find a vulnerability they also attempt to close it
## 2.0 Architecture and Design
### 2.1 Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment
- **Configuration Management**:
    - Diagrams: 
        - A physical representation of your enviornment including the devices connected 
    - Baseline Configuration:
        - the 'normal' congiguration before changes are applied
    - Standard Naming Conventions:
        - it's important to have standards for naming devices on the network so all IT personnel can understand what devices are connected in the enviornment just by reading the names 
    - Internet Protocol (IP) schema:
        - IP addresses that are assigned by the IT department should be done so in a standardized way to make it easier to determine what device is what based on it's IP address 
- **Data Soverignty**:
    - The right to access and control one's own datathis is dependent on geographical location, the GDPRin the EU for example protects citizens data Soverignty
- **Data Protection**:  
    - Data Loss Prevention (DLP):
        - Systems on the network that can prevent specific data from leaving the network 
    - Masking:
        - Covering up portions of data to keep it private, like replacing credit card numbers with stars on a receipt 
    - Encryption:
        - Encryption is a means of taking data that is human or machine readable and making it unreadable
        - we call readable data plain text
        - and unreadable ciphertext
        - encryption is a two way process, to turn ciphertext back into plain text you will need an encryption key this key is mathemattically significant and used by encryption algorithms to scramble to data so that it can only be unscrambled by the same key
    - At rest:
        - data at rest reffers to data that is in storage and not currently being acted upon
    - In transit/motion
        - data in transit is data that is being transfered from one place to another usualy over the network 
    - In processing:
        - data in processing reffers to data that is currently being acted upon, usually this data is loaded into a devices RAM 
    - Tokenization:
        - This reffers to taking private data and replacing it with an pseudonymous identifier which acts as a place holder.
        - the placeholder is just a stand in to avoid the actual private data from being used
        - the placeholder is not mathemattically connected to the original data 
    - Rights Management:
        - protection over the use of proprietary data 
- **Geographical Considerations**:
    - Geographical location plays a significant role in how you manage security decisions in an organization
    - different countries and territories will have different regulations regarding data, and security standards
    - the GDPR is a big one in the EU which puts limits on what an organization can do with data collected from EU citizens like it cannot leave the EU 
- **Response and recovery controls**:
    - Tools that allow security professionals to respond to security events and recover from them 
- **Secure Sockets Layer(SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection**:
    - to monitor traffic organizations will decrypt encrypted web traffic to ensure it is not malicious then re-encrypt the traffic and send it to its intended destination
- **Hashing**:
    - Hashing is the process of representing data as a fixed length message digest
    - no two inputs should output produce the same message digest otherwise this is called a collision
    - hashing is a one way mathematical function meaning you cannot derrive the original data from the message digest 
    - hashing can help verify integrity because a changed input will result in a changed message digest
- **API Considerations**:
    - Application programming interfaces need to be managed securely so that they are not permitting attackers to exploit them to gain access to systems and data through malicious API calls 
- **Site Resiliency**:
    - Hot Site:
        - a backup site that has everything needed to maintain the functionality of the main site
    - Cold Site:
        - a backup site that doesn't any of the infrastructure to maintain the functionality of the main site, usually just a location that the organization can move to
    - Warm Site:
        - A backup site that has some of the infrastructure to resume the normal functionality of the main site 
- **Deception and Disruption**:
    - Honeypots:
        - A trap that is set for attackers to catch them in the act 
    - Honeyfile:
        - A specific file or data point that is set as a trap inetentionally for attackers to take, if you see this honeyfile appear on the web you know someone fell for the bait
    - Honeynet:
        - an intentionally vulnerable network setup to trick attackers 
    - Fake telemetry:
        - fake telemetry data designed to lure in attackers and catch them
    - DNS sinkhole:
        - Setting up a DNS resolver to resolve known malicious domains to benign sites in order to stop users from visiting them 
### 2.2 Summarize Virtualization and Cloud Computing Concepts 
- **Cloud Models**:
    - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
        - computing hardware provided for a fee that can be accessed over the internet
    - Platform as a Service (PaaS):
        - a platform to develop applications provided for a fee that can be accessed over the internet 
    - Software as a Service (SaaS): 
        - An full application that is provided for a fee over the internet 
    - Anything as a Service (XaaS):
        - reffers to anything that is provided for a fee over the internet 
    - Public Clouds:
        - Cloud computing enviornment that is shared and accessible to the public  
    - Private Clouds:
        - Cloud computing enviornment reserved exclusively for a specific organization 
    - Hybrid Clouds:
        - Cloud enviornments that have some portions reserved for a specific organization while some portions are accessible to the general public 
- **Cloud Service Providers**:
    - Business that sells the use of it's computing hardware to people and organizations 
- **Managed Service Provider(MSP)/Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)**:
    - MSP:
        - Managed service providers remotely provide IT functions to an organization
    - MSSP:
        - Managed Security Service Providers remotely provide security specific functions to an organization
- **On-premises**:
    - Hardware under the control of your organization that resides within its facilities 
- **Off-premises**:
    - Hardware used by your organization that is notlocated within its facilities, can be controlled by your organization or a seperate entity 
- **Fog computing**:
    - Cloud model in which some of the data is processed locally on the device before being sent to the cloud 
- **Edge computing**:
    - Cloud model in which some of the data is processed in a centeralized location on the local network before being sent to the cloud 
- **Thin client**:
    - Small low power computing device used to connect to a cloud service where the actualy computing tasks are done 
- **Containers**:
    - Software that isolates processes and applications all running on the same main operating system. Each application is only given the resources needed because all resources are still managed by the host OS 
- **Infrastructure as Code**:
    - Infrastructure as code is designing the devices and services an application will need  to access before hand using code so that it can be changed and reproduced each time the application is spun up
    - Software-defined networking (SDN):
        - A network infrastructure  pre-defined with code to be reproducable between application instances  
    - Software-defined visibility (SDV):
        - security infrastructure, such as firewalls and IPS, pre-defined with code to be reproduced for different application instances 
- **Serverless Architecture**:
    - Applications that run in a cloud enviornment with all of the backend functions such as servers being allocated by the cloud provider on an as needed basis, for example the database wouldn't be statically running all the time, instead the resources to write to the data base would be provisioned when necessary 
- **Servcies Integration**:
    - A centeralized way to manage cloud enviornments running from different cloud providers 
- **Resource Policies**:
    - The ability to set limits on the access of cloud resources a specific user has
- **Transite Gateway**:
    - A router that connects users of an application or service to the right place in the cloud 
- **Virtualization**:
    - Virtualization is running multiple operating systems on a single set of hardware through the use of software known as a hypervisor 
    - resources are provisioned before hand and managed by the hypervisor 
    - Virtual Machine (VM) sprawl avoidance:
        - VM sprawl is when too many virtual machines are running on the same hardware wasting all the resources 
        - to prevent this we need to audit what VMs are running and if they're truly necessary 
    - VM escapre protection:
        - Malware can attempt to escape the isolatedvirtualized enviornment and interact directly with hypervisor
        - it's important to closely monitor VMs for signs of an attack 
### 2.3 Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts 
- **Enviornment**:
    - Development:
        - an application being actively created 
    - Test:
        - testing the application and how newley created features interact with eachother 
    - Staging:
        - An enviornment closer to the real-world where all functions are tested using real word scenarios 
    - Production:
        - Production level code is ready to be shipped and used in the real world 
    - Quality Assurance (QA):
        - The QA teams test all features and functions of an application to before it goes into production
- **Provisioning**:
    - making the all the resources for an application availible 
- **Deprovisioning**:
    - making sure all the resources are able to be used again by something else after an application is no longer runnign 
- **Secure Coding Techniques**:
    - Normalization:
        - Correcting user entered data to ensure it is in the correct format
    - Stored Procedures:
        - Functions that are not defined in the application itself but rather the resource it's accessing, for example instead of formulating a query in the application the query is stored in the database and called via the application to prevent code injections 
    - Obfuscation/camouflage:
        - Taking human readable code and turning it into something unreadable without changing it's functionality 
    - Code reuse:
        - code that is copied from one application to another can be a security concern because if one app is vulnerable the other is too 
    - Dead code:
        - code that runs in an application but doesn't do anything 
    - Server-side vs. Client-side execution and validation:
        - Server-side validation:
            - input is sent to the server and then validated before executing
        - Client-side validation: 
            - input is validated locally in the application itself, then executed and sent to the server after 
    - Memory management:
        - it is important to free up memory that is no longer used, and allocate memory properly in code to prevent buffer overflows, null pointer de-reference and other memory based attacks 
    - Use of third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs): 
        - it is common to use libraries and development kits not created by the language maintainers to add extra functions to a coding language, this however can introduce various risks and vulnerabilities and these third-party sources need to be heavily audited 
    - Data Exposure:
        - ensure that data flowing through an application is at no point exposed to a potential bad actor through things like encryption and hashing of passwords 
- **Open Web Applicn Secruity Project (OWASP)**:
    - Organization that helps web applications prevent common app vulnerabilities 
- **Sofware Diversity**:
    - Compiler:
        - telling the compile to create the software using different paths every time to make the resulting binary file unique to each build 
    - Binary:
        - Unique binary files will slow attackers ability to find vulnerabilities 
- **Automation/scripting**:
    - Automated courses of action:
        - automation is used to make a list of tasks repeatable and reproducible, meaning the same course of action can be repeated at machine speed 
    - Continuous Monitoring:
        - It can be useful to monitor a resource continually using automation so that if it reaches a certain threshhold action can be taken automatically 
    - Continuous Validation:
        - monitoring an application or behavior to ensure it is acting consistently 
    - Continuous integration:
        - automating portions of the development process so that even if new code is consistently added it is always checked for security and properly merged with exsisting code 
    - Continuous Delivery:
        - Automating testing and release portions of the development process 
    - Continuous deployment:
        - Automating the development process down tothe deployment of the application, meaning when all the automated checks are clear the app automatically is deployed to production 
- **Elasticity**:
    - The ability of infrastructure to scale resources up or down to handle demand placed on it by applications
- **Scalability**:
    - the ability of an application and its backend infrastructure to handle growing demands from increasing userbase 
- **Version Control**:
    - Software that can track and manage changes made to code during the application development process
