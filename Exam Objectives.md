    - Keyloggers:
        - software that captures users keystrokes, usually to steal credentials and spy 
    - Remote Access Trojan(RAT): 
        - malware designed to look benign but actually provides the attacker with remote control over a users system
    - Rootkit: 
        - malware that hides itself in low level operating system files to avoid detection, can be hard to find 
    - Backdoor: 
        - an opening in a piece of software intentially left to provide access to those who know about it, can be left by the dev or an attacker
- **Password attacks**:
    - attacks designed to break find out a password
    - Dictionary:
        - a password attack that uses a long word list trying every single one to see if it's the password
    - Bruteforce: 
        - Password attack that tries every single password possible to guess the password
        - Offline: 
            - offline bruteforce uses the hashed passwords and compares hashes of every possible password against the known password's hash
        - Online:

    - Structured query Language (SQL):
        - injecting an sql query into an input field to get information from a database
        - inputting: "105 OR 1=1" into the input field would execute the SQL query: ``SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;``
    - Dynamic-link library (DLL):
        - DLLs are libraries used in Windows, injecting a DLL into a different application can allow for the functions from that library to be run with the Privelege of the other application

    - Time of check/time of use (TOCTOU):
        - making changes to something an application may need after it is checked by the app but before it is used, causing the app to behave unexpectedly 
- **Error Handling**:
    - application error messages can be too verbose and provide an attacker with too much information
    - applications need to properly handle errors as not to give an attacker more access in the event of an error
- **Improper Input Handling**:

- **Replay Attack**:
    - when an attacker captures a users traffic and sends it on to the server to appear that it's coming from the user
    - Session Replays:
        - using an active session ID to pose as a user

- **Resource Exhaustion**:
    - Denial of Service (DOS) attack that uses an application to use up all of the computing resources causing the target to become unresponsive
- **Memory Leak**:
    - When an application doesn't free up unused memory the memory of the system is continually used up until it's no longer usable
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping**: 
    - on path attack where the attacker sits in the middle of a conversation between a victim and a web server, forcing the victim to communicate with them in the clear and then encrypting the traffic and sending it to the web server. This way it looks to the user that the server is communicating unencrypted and to the server that the user is using encryption
- **Driver Manipulation**:
    - drivers are what's used to communicate with a computer's hardware, manipulating drivers can allow attackers to exploit portions of the system or operating system
    - Shimming:
        - adding extra code into operating system shims or areas where information is stored between OS components to run the codewithout detection  
    - Refactoring:
        - manipulating the driver in a way that it still appears to behave the same on the users end but actually has hidden malicious functions

        - specific methods, and behaviors that a certain threat will exhibit. allowing you to recognize what threat actor is targeting you
### 1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities
- **Cloud-based vs. on-premises vulnerabilities**:
    - When in a cloud enviornment you are trusting the physical security of your sytem with a third party, this can be beneficial if you trust the organization and they are larger than your own
    - Cloud enviornments can be more exposed because they're accessed via the internet whereas on premises systems can be segmented from the public internet more easily
- **Zero-day**:
    - a vulnerability that has not been seen in the wild, and thus cannot be patched by the vendor. It has been known about publicly for zero days when discovered or used for the first time
- **Weak configurations**:
    - Open Permissions:
        - if your permissions are left too open then low level accounts can access data and resources that should be only availible to higher level users
    - Unsecure root accounts:
        - if the root accounts are not secured propely attackers will have an easier time bypassing authentication and gaining privileged access to your systems 
    - Errors:
        - If errors are left unchecked in your configurations attackers can bypass security controls 
    - Weak Encryption:
        - weak encryption is vulnerable to bruteforce attacks or can be bypassed by some error in its implementation, this will allow to access whatever the encryption was protecting 
    - Unsecure Protocols:
        - if unsecure protocols are used within the organization they're vulnerable to exploitation and are not an effective security control 
    - Default settings:
        - default settings are known publicly and thus the gaps in their security are already known to attackers, this is an easy first place to look 
    - Open ports and services:
        - opening ports and services beyond what is strictly necessary introduces unwanted vulnerabilities into your systems 
- **Third Party Risks**:
    - Vendor management:
        - System Integration:
            - Third party access to internal systems needs to have proper security controls applied, for authentication, permissions etc. 
        - Lack of Vendor Support:
            - lacking vendor support can leave hardware and software out of date and insecure
            - making sure that vendors are aware of issues and capable of fixing them in a timely manner 
    - Supply Chain:
        - The chain of vendors that it takes to bring a product or service to production can introduce many vulnerabilities
        - it's important to verify your vendors, and verify where their materials are coming from 
        - it's possible for vulnerabilities to be introduced up the chain to a part where your organization has no control 
    - Outsourced code development:
        - If development of applications is occuring outside of your organization it is important to vet third party development security 
        - this can include the location of the source code. If the development is done by a third party but the code is stored in house than you'd need to ensure secure access of the code
    - Data storage
        - if data generated by your organization is held by a third party it's important to assess the security posture of the storage locations to ensure the data is accessible and in safe hands
        - this should be agreed upon before entering a partnership with a third-party
- **Improper or weak patch management**:
    - Firmware:
        - Firmware is run at a hardware level and necessary for adevice to function
        - often times firmware patches cannot be applied automatically over the air and need to be updated manually
        - this is often a problem for IOT devices who may not receive frequent firmware updates and thus can remain vulnerable 
    - Operating System (OS):
        - Operating System updates can often be applied automatically and over the air
        - it's important to test updates before rolling them out to all machines to ensure they'll continue to function properly
        - OS updates can contain security patches that close OS level vulnerabilities and thus should be made a priorty when they're released
    - Applications:
        - Application specific updates can typically be set to automatically apply
        - These updates can add new features and functions but also can increase the security of the application 
        - it's important to test these updates to ensure that they won't hinder the applicationsn functionality 
- **Legacy Platforms**:
    - legacy platforms are no longer supported by their developers
    - this can mean no more security patches or vendor support
    - legacy software may use outdated encryption or protocols that are no longer in use
- **Impacts**:
    - Dataloss:
        - The loss of data that is valuable to the organization can result from the failure or exploitation of systems 
    - Data Breaches:
        - leaking sensitive data to the public 
    - Data exfiltration:
        - data leaving the control of the organization without necessariliy being lost
