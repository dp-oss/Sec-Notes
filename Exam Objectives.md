    - Keyloggers:
        - software that captures users keystrokes, usually to steal credentials and spy 
    - Remote Access Trojan(RAT): 
        - malware designed to look benign but actually provides the attacker with remote control over a users system
    - Rootkit: 
        - malware that hides itself in low level operating system files to avoid detection, can be hard to find 
    - Backdoor: 
        - an opening in a piece of software intentially left to provide access to those who know about it, can be left by the dev or an attacker
- **Password attacks**:
    - attacks designed to break find out a password
    - Dictionary:
        - a password attack that uses a long word list trying every single one to see if it's the password
    - Bruteforce: 
        - Password attack that tries every single password possible to guess the password
        - Offline: 
            - offline bruteforce uses the hashed passwords and compares hashes of every possible password against the known password's hash
        - Online:

    - Structured query Language (SQL):
        - injecting an sql query into an input field to get information from a database
        - inputting: "105 OR 1=1" into the input field would execute the SQL query: ``SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;``
    - Dynamic-link library (DLL):
        - DLLs are libraries used in Windows, injecting a DLL into a different application can allow for the functions from that library to be run with the Privelege of the other application

    - Time of check/time of use (TOCTOU):
        - making changes to something an application may need after it is checked by the app but before it is used, causing the app to behave unexpectedly 
- **Error Handling**:
    - application error messages can be too verbose and provide an attacker with too much information
    - applications need to properly handle errors as not to give an attacker more access in the event of an error
- **Improper Input Handling**:

- **Replay Attack**:
    - when an attacker captures a users traffic and sends it on to the server to appear that it's coming from the user
    - Session Replays:
        - using an active session ID to pose as a user

- **Resource Exhaustion**:
    - Denial of Service (DOS) attack that uses an application to use up all of the computing resources causing the target to become unresponsive
- **Memory Leak**:
    - When an application doesn't free up unused memory the memory of the system is continually used up until it's no longer usable
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping**: 
    - on path attack where the attacker sits in the middle of a conversation between a victim and a web server, forcing the victim to communicate with them in the clear and then encrypting the traffic and sending it to the web server. This way it looks to the user that the server is communicating unencrypted and to the server that the user is using encryption
- **Driver Manipulation**:
    - drivers are what's used to communicate with a computer's hardware, manipulating drivers can allow attackers to exploit portions of the system or operating system
    - Shimming:
        - adding extra code into operating system shims or areas where information is stored between OS components to run the codewithout detection  
    - Refactoring:
        - manipulating the driver in a way that it still appears to behave the same on the users end but actually has hidden malicious functions

        - specific methods, and behaviors that a certain threat will exhibit. allowing you to recognize what threat actor is targeting you
### 1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities
- **Cloud-based vs. on-premises vulnerabilities**:
    - When in a cloud enviornment you are trusting the physical security of your sytem with a third party, this can be beneficial if you trust the organization and they are larger than your own
    - Cloud enviornments can be more exposed because they're accessed via the internet whereas on premises systems can be segmented from the public internet more easily
- **Zero-day**:
    - a vulnerability that has not been seen in the wild, and thus cannot be patched by the vendor. It has been known about publicly for zero days when discovered or used for the first time
- **Weak configurations**:
    - Open Permissions:
        - if your permissions are left too open then low level accounts can access data and resources that should be only availible to higher level users
    - Unsecure root accounts:
        - if the root accounts are not secured propely attackers will have an easier time bypassing authentication and gaining privileged access to your systems 
    - Errors:
        - If errors are left unchecked in your configurations attackers can bypass security controls 
    - Weak Encryption:
        - weak encryption is vulnerable to bruteforce attacks or can be bypassed by some error in its implementation, this will allow to access whatever the encryption was protecting 
    - Unsecure Protocols:
        - if unsecure protocols are used within the organization they're vulnerable to exploitation and are not an effective security control 
    - Default settings:
        - default settings are known publicly and thus the gaps in their security are already known to attackers, this is an easy first place to look 
    - Open ports and services:
        - opening ports and services beyond what is strictly necessary introduces unwanted vulnerabilities into your systems 
- **Third Party Risks**:
    - Vendor management:
        - System Integration:
            - Third party access to internal systems needs to have proper security controls applied, for authentication, permissions etc. 
        - Lack of Vendor Support:
            - lacking vendor support can leave hardware and software out of date and insecure
            - making sure that vendors are aware of issues and capable of fixing them in a timely manner 
    - Supply Chain:
        - The chain of vendors that it takes to bring a product or service to production can introduce many vulnerabilities
        - it's important to verify your vendors, and verify where their materials are coming from 
        - it's possible for vulnerabilities to be introduced up the chain to a part where your organization has no control 
    - Outsourced code development:
        - If development of applications is occuring outside of your organization it is important to vet third party development security 
        - this can include the location of the source code. If the development is done by a third party but the code is stored in house than you'd need to ensure secure access of the code
    - Data storage
        - if data generated by your organization is held by a third party it's important to assess the security posture of the storage locations to ensure the data is accessible and in safe hands
        - this should be agreed upon before entering a partnership with a third-party
- **Improper or weak patch management**:
    - Firmware:
        - Firmware is run at a hardware level and necessary for adevice to function
        - often times firmware patches cannot be applied automatically over the air and need to be updated manually
        - this is often a problem for IOT devices who may not receive frequent firmware updates and thus can remain vulnerable 
    - Operating System (OS):
        - Operating System updates can often be applied automatically and over the air
        - it's important to test updates before rolling them out to all machines to ensure they'll continue to function properly
        - OS updates can contain security patches that close OS level vulnerabilities and thus should be made a priorty when they're released
    - Applications:
        - Application specific updates can typically be set to automatically apply
        - These updates can add new features and functions but also can increase the security of the application 
        - it's important to test these updates to ensure that they won't hinder the applicationsn functionality 
- **Legacy Platforms**:
    - legacy platforms are no longer supported by their developers
    - this can mean no more security patches or vendor support
    - legacy software may use outdated encryption or protocols that are no longer in use
- **Impacts**:
    - Dataloss:
        - The loss of data that is valuable to the organization can result from the failure or exploitation of systems 
    - Data Breaches:
        - leaking sensitive data to the public 
    - Data exfiltration:
        - data leaving the control of the organization without necessariliy being lost
        - can be leaked in a breach later
        - can contain IP or trad secrets
    - Identity theft:
        - if personal information is leaked in a breach it can be used to commit fraud and result in the customer's Identity being stolen 
    - Financial:
        - Organizations can be exploited financially by threat actors, through things like ransomware, or directly through theft, and through loss of potential sales
    - Reputation:
        - Falling victim to an attack can lead to a loss of reputation for an organization and decrease the trust consumers will have in the future, this can also influence stock prices if the company is traded publicly 
    - Availibility Loss:
        - if an attack rendors users unable to access their services a company can lose profits, reputation, etc.
### 1.7 Summarize the techniques used in security assessments 
- **Threat Hunting**:

        - Aggregating intelligence from multiple sources and using tools to analyze trends in the data 
    - Threat feeds:
        - active advisements of the current threat landscape, what attackers are out there and what vulnerabilities they're exploiting
    - Advisories and bulletins:
        - Urgent security updates delivered in a standard place
    - Maneuver:
        - taking action to avoid security concerns 
- **Vulnerability Scans**:
    - False positives:
        - Something marked as a vulnerability to be investigated, but actually is benign
    - False Negatives:
        - Something marked as being safe that is actually a vulnerability
    - Log Reviews:
        - reviwing log reporting to locate threats 
    - Credentialed vs Non-credentialed:
        - scanning from the point of view of someone who doesn't have internal accecss to the network is Non-credentialed
        - scanning from inside the network is Credentialed
    - Intrusive vs Non-intrusive:
        - Scans that only look to see what's open on the network without affecting operation is called Non-intrusive
        - something that has the potential to dirsupt operations would be konwn as intrusive like a penetration test
    - Application:
        - A vulnerability scan within the scope of a single application
    - Web Application:
        - vulnerability scan within the scope of an active web application
    - Network:
        - Vulnerability scan within the scope of an entire network, will include things like what ports are open and what services are running on those ports
    - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
        - CVE is the most popular database of vulnerabilities that have been reported this is run by the MITRE coorperation
        - CVSS is the scoring system used to rank vulnerabilitiesbased on severity, this rating is given from 0 being least severeto 10 being most severe
- **Syslog/Security Information Event Management (SIEM)**: 
    - Syslog:
        - standard for sending log files to a SIEM
    - SIEM:
        - a single database that aggregates security data to be analyzed
    - Review Reports:
        - Its important to review all security reports to determine if there is a vulnerability or an active threat 
    - Packet Capture:
        - Network Packets can be captured and sent to the SIEM to be analyzed 
    - Data Inputs:
        - sources of data that can be sent to a SIEM 
    - User Behavior Analysis:
        - It's important to analyze user behavior to find changes to patterns that can indicate an attack on that user's account 
    - Security Monitoring:
        - people in a SOC will monitor SIEMs for security events to be able to respond to events as they occur
    - Log Aggregation:
        - Inputting data from all different system logs to analyze in the SIEM, an essential function of a SIEM 
    - Log Collectors:
        - A part of the SIEM that waits for syslog messages to input data

### 1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing 
- **Penetration Testing**:
    - A pen tester attempts to break into systems to
 learn about their vulnerabilities
    - Known Enviornment:
        - When the pen tester is given information about the systems before going into the test
    - Unknown enviornment:
        - when the pen tester is given no information prior to the penetration test and approaches it as an outsider
    - Partially known enviornment:
        - when the pen tester is given partial information before conducting the pen test, this simulates someone who may have a little information about the system such as an insider 
    - Rules of engagement:
        - the scope of the penetration test, what is the pen tester allowed to attempt to break into
    - Lateral Movement:
        - Moving from one device to another inside of the enviornment
    - Privilege Escalation:
        - Increasing ones access to a system from a position of lower access
    - Persistence:
        - The ability of a threat to remain on a system 
    - Cleanup:
        - Returning everything in the enviornment to its normal state afte a pentest
    - Bug bounty:
        - Companies will offer bug bounties to the public to penetration test specific portions of their service, this is a reward for finding vulnerabilities or bugs
    - Pivoting:
        - Using a system as a jumping off point to gain access to other systems 
**Passive and active Reconnaissance**:
    - Passive Reconnaissance:
        - Gaining information about a target wihtout alerting them to your presence
    - Active Reconnaissance:
        - Gaining information about a target in a way that may let the target know they're being scoped out

        - Developing an understanding of what devices exist on a network 
    - OSINT:
        - Open source intelligence, gathering information from publicly availible sources 
- **Exercise Types**:
    - Red-team:
        - The attacker in a simulated scenario, they look for vulnerabilities in an organization
    - Blue-team:
        - the defender in a simulated scenario, they try to secure the assests and defend them from attack
    - White-team:
        - Manages both teams, determines what was learned from an exercise
    - Purple-team:
        - preforms actions both attacking and defending, if they find a vulnerability they also attempt to close it
## 2.0 Architecture and Design
### 2.1 Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment
- **Configuration Management**:
    - Diagrams: 
        - A physical representation of your enviornment including the devices connected 
    - Baseline Configuration:
        - the 'normal' congiguration before changes are applied
    - Standard Naming Conventions:
        - it's important to have standards for naming devices on the network so all IT personnel can understand what devices are connected in the enviornment just by reading the names 
    - Internet Protocol (IP) schema:
        - IP addresses that are assigned by the IT department should be done so in a standardized way to make it easier to determine what device is what based on it's IP address 
- **Data Soverignty**:
    - The right to access and control one's own datathis is dependent on geographical location, the GDPRin the EU for example protects citizens data Soverignty
- **Data Protection**:  
    - Data Loss Prevention (DLP):
        - Systems on the network that can prevent specific data from leaving the network 
    - Masking:
        - Covering up portions of data to keep it private, like replacing credit card numbers with stars on a receipt 
    - Encryption:
        - Encryption is a means of taking data that is human or machine readable and making it unreadable
        - we call readable data plain text
        - and unreadable ciphertext
        - encryption is a two way process, to turn ciphertext back into plain text you will need an encryption key this key is mathemattically significant and used by encryption algorithms to scramble to data so that it can only be unscrambled by the same key
    - At rest:
        - data at rest reffers to data that is in storage and not currently being acted upon
    - In transit/motion
        - data in transit is data that is being transfered from one place to another usualy over the network 
    - In processing:
        - data in processing reffers to data that is currently being acted upon, usually this data is loaded into a devices RAM 
    - Tokenization:
        - This reffers to taking private data and replacing it with an pseudonymous identifier which acts as a place holder.
        - the placeholder is just a stand in to avoid the actual private data from being used
        - the placeholder is not mathemattically connected to the original data 
    - Rights Management:
        - protection over the use of proprietary data 
- **Geographical Considerations**:
    - Geographical location plays a significant role in how you manage security decisions in an organization
    - different countries and territories will have different regulations regarding data, and security standards
    - the GDPR is a big one in the EU which puts limits on what an organization can do with data collected from EU citizens like it cannot leave the EU 
- **Response and recovery controls**:
    - Tools that allow security professionals to respond to security events and recover from them 
- **Secure Sockets Layer(SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection**:
    - to monitor traffic organizations will decrypt encrypted web traffic to ensure it is not malicious then re-encrypt the traffic and send it to its intended destination
- **Hashing**:
    - Hashing is the process of representing data as a fixed length message digest
    - no two inputs should output produce the same message digest otherwise this is called a collision
    - hashing is a one way mathematical function meaning you cannot derrive the original data from the message digest 
    - hashing can help verify integrity because a changed input will result in a changed message digest
- **API Considerations**:
    - Application programming interfaces need to be managed securely so that they are not permitting attackers to exploit them to gain access to systems and data through malicious API calls 
- **Site Resiliency**:
    - Hot Site:
        - a backup site that has everything needed to maintain the functionality of the main site
    - Cold Site:
        - a backup site that doesn't any of the infrastructure to maintain the functionality of the main site, usually just a location that the organization can move to
    - Warm Site:
        - A backup site that has some of the infrastructure to resume the normal functionality of the main site 
- **Deception and Disruption**:
    - Honeypots:
        - A trap that is set for attackers to catch them in the act 
    - Honeyfile:
        - A specific file or data point that is set as a trap inetentionally for attackers to take, if you see this honeyfile appear on the web you know someone fell for the bait
    - Honeynet:
        - an intentionally vulnerable network setup to trick attackers 
    - Fake telemetry:
        - fake telemetry data designed to lure in attackers and catch them
    - DNS sinkhole:

    - Small low power computing device used to connect to a cloud service where the actualy computing tasks are done 
- **Containers**:
    - Software that isolates processes and applications all running on the same main operating system. Each application is only given the resources needed because all resources are still managed by the host OS 
- **Infrastructure as Code**:
    - Infrastructure as code is designing the devices and services an application will need  to access before hand using code so that it can be changed and reproduced each time the application is spun up
    - Software-defined networking (SDN):
        - A network infrastructure  pre-defined with code to be reproducable between application instances  
    - Software-defined visibility (SDV):
        - security infrastructure, such as firewalls and IPS, pre-defined with code to be reproduced for different application instances 
- **Serverless Architecture**:
    - Applications that run in a cloud enviornment with all of the backend functions such as servers being allocated by the cloud provider on an as needed basis, for example the database wouldn't be statically running all the time, instead the resources to write to the data base would be provisioned when necessary 
- **Servcies Integration**:
    - A centeralized way to manage cloud enviornments running from different cloud providers 
- **Resource Policies**:
    - The ability to set limits on the access of cloud resources a specific user has
- **Transite Gateway**:
    - A router that connects users of an application or service to the right place in the cloud 
- **Virtualization**:
    - Virtualization is running multiple operating systems on a single set of hardware through the use of software known as a hypervisor 
    - resources are provisioned before hand and managed by the hypervisor 
    - Virtual Machine (VM) sprawl avoidance:
        - VM sprawl is when too many virtual machines are running on the same hardware wasting all the resources 
        - to prevent this we need to audit what VMs are running and if they're truly necessary 
    - VM escapre protection:
        - Malware can attempt to escape the isolatedvirtualized enviornment and interact directly with hypervisor
        - it's important to closely monitor VMs for signs of an attack 
### 2.3 Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts 
- **Enviornment**:

    - Obfuscation/camouflage:
        - Taking human readable code and turning it into something unreadable without changing it's functionality 
    - Code reuse:
        - code that is copied from one application to another can be a security concern because if one app is vulnerable the other is too 
    - Dead code:
        - code that runs in an application but doesn't do anything 
    - Server-side vs. Client-side execution and validation:
        - Server-side validation:
            - input is sent to the server and then validated before executing
        - Client-side validation: 
            - input is validated locally in the application itself, then executed and sent to the server after 
    - Memory management:
        - it is important to free up memory that is no longer used, and allocate memory properly in code to prevent buffer overflows, null pointer de-reference and other memory based attacks 
    - Use of third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs): 
        - it is common to use libraries and development kits not created by the language maintainers to add extra functions to a coding language, this however can introduce various risks and vulnerabilities and these third-party sources need to be heavily audited 
    - Data Exposure:
        - ensure that data flowing through an application is at no point exposed to a potential bad actor through things like encryption and hashing of passwords 
- **Open Web Applicn Secruity Project (OWASP)**:

        - Unique binary files will slow attackers ability to find vulnerabilities 
- **Automation/scripting**:
    - Automated courses of action:
        - automation is used to make a list of tasks repeatable and reproducible, meaning the same course of action can be repeated at machine speed

        - Phone call: 
            - a user is called and authenticates with a key or code that is read over the phone 
    - Smart card authentication:
         - A card containing a chip usually NFC that authenticates a user
- **Biometrics**:
    - A physical characteristic of a user 
    - Fingerprint:

        - When a user is not identified using biometrics when they should've been 
    - Crossover error rate:
        - the point when false rejections and false acceptances occur at the same rate
        - this is where you want your biometric authentication to be 
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA) factors and Attributes**:

        - Vefifying that the person trying to access a resource is who they say they are
    - Authorization:
        - Verifying that the person attempting to access a resource is allowed to do so
    - Accounting:
        - the ability to review the actions a person took while accessing a resource 
- **Cloud vs On-premises requirements**:
    - In cloud enviornments it is crucial to Authenticate users before access to any resource, you need to ensure that proper premissions authorize the user to access the correct resources, and logs will help account for the actions they've taken
    - On-premises personnel needs to authenticate before accessing specific portions of the facility, we need to ensure only authorized personnel are able to access specific places in the facility, and audit who went where and accessed what 
### 2.5 Given a scenario, implement cybersecurity resilience 
- **Redundancy**:
    - Geographical dispersal:
        - It is important that key pieces of an organizations infrastructure reside in different geographic locations to avoid a single disaster taking out all functions
    - Disk:
        - Redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID) levels:
            - RAID 0:
                - Striping without parity, data is spread across multiple disks, not redundant, losing one drive and all the data is lost 
           - RAID 1:
                - Mirroring, data is duplicated across disks, if one fails the others will have it, requires twice the disk space 
            - RAID 5:
                - Striping with parity 
                - 1 extra drive needed for parity and 1 extra dive needed for striping(spliting data between drives), 
                - a single lost drive can be rebuilt using parity information 
                - minimum of 3 drives required

            - RAID 10 or 1+0:
                - Combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0, data is split between drives with striping and then mirrored across drives for redundancy
                - requires 4 drives

### 2.8 Summarize the basics of cryptography concepts
- **Digital Signatures**:
    - encrypting a hash of data using an encryption key
    - ensures integrity using hash
    - provides non-repudiation and authentication through encryption 
- **Key Length**:
    - The longer the encryption key the longer a brute force attack on the key will take 
- **Key Stretching**:
    - Methods to increase the length of an encryption key
    - hashing multiple times for example
- **Salting**:
    - adding extra data to the data you're hashing so that two exact same inputs will have different message digests
    - common with passwords because people will use the same passwords as oneanother 
- **Hashing**:
    - A one way algorithm that converts data to a fixed length string known as a message digest
    - can't derive original data from the message digest
    - common for password storage so that plain text passwords are never stored only the message digests or hashed passwords 
    - The same data will always produce the same message digest
- **Key exchange**:
    - The exchange of an encryption key between both sides of a conversation
    - common method is diffie helman where both users public encryption key is exchanged than combined with the other users private key to create a single symmetric key shared by both parties that was never shared publicly 
- **Elliptic-Curve Cryptography**:
    - algorithm to create asymmetric encryption keys based upon algabraic expressions of an elliptic curve over finite fields  
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**:
    - updating a shared encryption key frequently to prevent brute forcing encrypted communications after the fact 
- **Quantum**:
    - Communications:
        - in quantum mechanics observing a quantum bit changes it
        - quantum communications uses this fact to distribute keys securely because intercepting the encryption key would change it 
    - Computing:
        - Computing based on quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics
        - instead of normal bits which have a state of 1 or 0 quantum bits or qbits can be anywhere between 1 and zero
        - due to this quantum computers are signiciantly more powerful than standard computers
        - this means they'll be able to brute force encryption algorithms much faster than a regular computer
- **Post-quantum**:
    - Post-quantum algorithms are protected against brute force by quantum computers by using more complex alogorithms than standard encryption
- **Ephemeral**:
    - an encryption key that is only used a single time
- **Modes of operation**:
    - Authenticated Encryption (AE):
        -  encrypts data and verifies authenticity 
        - takes the plaintext and encryption key
        - outputs ciphertext and also an authentication tag which can be used during decryption to verify authenticity 
    - Unauthenticated: 
        - Encrypts the data but doesn't verify the authenticity 
        - this means that the ciphertext can be changedwhich would cause the resulting decrypted plaintext to change 
    - Counter:
        - Encrypts the first block of data using a randomly generated initialization vector, each subsequent block is XOR'd ((exclusive OR) meaning each bit is compared and if they're the same then the resulting bit is 0but if they're different the resulting bit is one ) the initialization vector is then incremented with each block that is encrypted 
- **Blockchain**:
    - Public Ledgers:
        - A distributed way of verifying transactions of cryptocurrency 
        - Transactions are signed and added to the ledger
        - before a transaction is made they're verified using the distributed ledger to ensure no one can send more currency than they own 
- **Cipher Suites**:
    - Stream:
        - Ciphers that encrypt data a single bit at a time
    - Block:
        - Block ciphers encrypt data broken up into chunks called blocks 
- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric**:
    - Symmetric Cryptography:
        - Data is encrypted using a single key then decrypted with the same key 
    - Asymmetric data:
        - Asymmetric systems have two keys that are mathemattically connected
        - The private key is held only by you and can be used to encrypt data or decrypt data that has been encrypted with the public key  
        - The public key can be shared with anyone and either decrypts data that has been encrypted with the public key, or encrypts data so that it can only be encrypted using the private key 
- **Lightweight Cryptography**:
    - Cryptographic algorithms can be intensive to compute
    - lightweight cryptography uses algorithms that are specifically designed to be less intensive allowing weaker hardware to encrypt and decrypt data
    - common for IoT, embedded, and mobile devices 
- **Steganography**:
    - Hiding data in plain sight, placing it in the binary of other data files, which can be decoded or decrypted 
    - Audio:
        - Audio Steganography hides data within audio files that sound normal unless decrypted
    - Video:
        - Hiding data in videos can be done with video steganography
        - video appears normal unless decrypted
    - Image:
        - Image steganography hides data within thebits that make up the image
        - the image appears normal but can be decoded to output the hidden data 
- **Homomorphic Encryption**:
    - HE or Homomorphic Encryption allows data to be calculated upon while still being encrypted
    - removes the need to decrypt the data to run calculations on it
- **Common use cases**:
    - Low power devices:
        - devices such as embedded systems, IoT, and mobile devices still need to communicate using encryption
        - this is where lightweight encryption is useful 
    - Low latency:
        - Lightweight encryption requires less time to encrypt and decrypt data
        - this makes it perfect for low latency use cases such as encrypting wireless communications 
    - High Resiliency:
        - high resilience encryption has strong encryption keys and can be resistent in implementation to things such as side channel attacks 
    - Supporting Confidentiality:
        - when data is encrypted the only party that can access the data is one with the proper key, ensuring confidentiality
    - Supporting Integrity:
        - since no two inputs should produce the same hash/message digest you can verify the integrity of data by hashing the data and making sure the hash matches the original 
    - Supporting Obfuscation:
        - Encrypted data is unreadable to humans without the proper key to decrypt making it obfuscated
    - Supporting authentication:
        - Through the use of asymmetric encryption we can ensure the authenticity of a conversation because only the holder of the correct private key would be able to read data encrypted with the public key 
    - Supporting non-repudiation:  
        - Using asymmetric encryption we can ensure we're really communicating with the holder of the private key because anything they encrypt will only be decrypted with the corresponding public key, not anyone elses
- **Limitations**:
    - Speed:
        - The time it takes to encrypt and decrypt data can limit the speed with which data can be transfered and acted upon 
        - this is important for wireless cryptography where latency can degrade the quality of the connection 
    - Size:
        - encryption can increase the ammount of storage taken up by data if we have to hold both the cipher text and plain text in storage
        - some algorithms are limited in the size of data they can encrypt at one time 
        - larger files may need to be broken up before encryption 
    - Weak keys:
        - Encryption using weak keys is vulnerable to brute force attacks where they attacker guesses every single decryption key until the data is readable
    - Time:
        - Encryption and decryption adds extra time to operations
        - lightweight cryptography can help mitigate this 
    - Longevity:
        - As computing power increases encryption algorithms that once took a long period of time to brute force can be broken in much shorter ammounts of time 
    - Predictability:
        - if common patterns can be found in encryption and hashing algorithms the key may be reverse engineered or bruteforced faster 
    - Reuse:
        - reuse of the same encryption key would make the encryption less secure because there exists a possibility that the key has been comporomised previously 
    - Entropy:
        - Lower levels of entropy make the brute force of encryption keys much easier 
    - Computational overheads:
        - Encryption adds overhead to computing which can exhaust the resources of lower power devices 
        - Important for IoT/embedded/mobile devices
        - to mitigate the overhead in server settings we can use a HSM which can preform cryptographic algorithms 
    - Resource vs. security constraints:
        - given the constraints of encryption it is a balance between the cost of the encryption strength on your resources and the cost of having weak encryption on the security of the data 
## 3.0 Implementation
### 3.1 Given a scenario, implement secure protocols
- **Protocols**:
    - Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC):

        - ensures the privacy and authenticity of data sent over the public internet 
        - Authentication header (AH)/Encapsulating Security Payloads(ESP):
            - Authentication Header (AH):
                - Ensures the authenticity, and integrity of the data but doesn't encrypt the data  
                - hashes the packet and a key shared between both parties
                - hash is added onto the packet as a header 
                - prevents replay attacks
                    - packets sent out of sequence won't match the hash
            - Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP):
                - Encrypts AND authenticates the data 
                  - original packet is encrypted
                  - then the packed it hashed
                - ESP trailer is added to the packet, ESP header added to packet
                - Integrity check value is added to the packet as a footer
                - Often combined with AH which will verify integrity of the entire packet including ESP headers/trailers
            - Tunnel/transport:
                - IPSec has two modes: transfer mode and tunnel mode 
                    - Transfer mode:
                        - the original tcp/ip header remains unencrypted 
                        - the rest of the data is surrounded in IPSec headers and trailers
                    - Tunnel Mode:
                        - the entire packet including tcp/ip header is surrounded by IPsec header/trailer
                        - a new tcp/ip header is assigned to the packet 
    - Post Office Protocol (POP)/Internet Message Acess Protocol(IMAP):
        - POP and IMAP are email protocols and both have the option to encrypt their traffic using SSL/TLS 
- **Use Cases**:
    - Voice and Video:
        - voice and video calls require low latency to be transported correctly, this would use SRTP to encrypt data 
    - Time Synchronization:
        - Noramlly computers use NTP or network time protocol to sync their time with a centeralized time server 
        - To do so securely using encryption you would use NTPsec
    - Email and Web:
        - To secure email and web traffic you would send using Secure Sockets Layer or more likely Transport layer security 
            - both IMAP and POP have options for TLS 
        - To support asymmetric encryption of emails you can use the S/MIME protocol 
    - File Transfer:
        - Normally we can transfer files on the network using FTP 
        - This can be done securely using the FTPS protcol
        - Additionally this can be done through the encrypted SSH protocol by using SFTP or SSH File Transfer Protocol 
    - Directory Services:
        - To securely access a centeralized network directory you would use LDAPS which sends LDAP querries over SSL 
    - Remote Access:
        - You can use SSH or Secure Shell to securely access another computer remotely over the network  
    - Domain Name Resolution:
        - To send DNS requests securely using encryption you would use DNSSEC
    - Routing and Switching:
        - SNMPv3 can securely query routers and switches 
    - Network Address Allocation:
        - Usually DHCP is used to allocated IP addressses on the network 
        - To enhance security outside security controls need to be used
        - such as configuration changes on switches to limit what devices can act use DHCP to allocate addresses
    - Subscription Services:
        - Services such as Antivirus or IPS/IDS need their list of signatures constantly updated 
        - encryption can be used to ensure updates to this list are only coming from the verified 
### 3.2 Given a scenario, implement host or application security solutions
- **Endpoint Protection**:
    - Antivirus:
        - Antivirus software scans endpoints for signatures of common viruses 
        - often combined with anti-malware
    - Anti-malware:
        - scans for signatures to identify known malware that matches signatures in a database of malicious software
        - can also match signatures in a substring of a file or within memory allocated to a process 
    - Endpoint detection and Response (EDR):
        - Examines the behaviors of programs, files, and users on the system to detect if it's malicious 
        - can include an automated process to remove malicious software or files 
    - DLP:
        - Prevents the exfiltration of sensitive data from an organization over the network 
        - some solutions can block transfer to removable media
        - can run in the network or on endpoints
    - Next-generation Firewall (NGFW):
        - Allows or blocks network traffic based on an access control list
        - can view traffic at OSI layer 7 meaning at the application level
    - Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS):
        - Takes action to prevent the exploitation of systems
        - runs on endpoints 
    - Host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS):
        - detects and alerts of any security incedents on a system
        - runs on endpoints
    - Host-based firewall:
        - Allow or block traffic based on pre-defined rules
        - runs on endpoint Operating System
- **Boot Integrity**:
    - Boot security/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI):
        - Modern BIOS software standard
        - provides chain of trust for the boot process
        - Secure boot:
            - function of UEFI bios standard
            - verifies the digital signature of the bootloader for the operating system
            - next step is Trusted Boot
        - Trusted boot:
            - The bootloader then verifies the digital signature of the OS kernel 
            - the kernel continues to verify all other OS startup components
            - additionally the kernel runs anti malware to ensure no part of the startup has been exploited 
    - Measured Boot:
        - verifies all boot components against a hash stored by UEFI in the trusted platform module (TPM) the tpm is a hardware component
    - Boot attestation:
        - A report verifying the integrity of the boot process
        - can be digitally signed by the TPM and remotely sent to a centeral management server 
        - this allows admins to verify that the system booted properly 
- **Database**:
    - Tokenization:
        - Storing sensitive data using a unique placeholder instead of the actual data
        - this place holder is just a stand in, it is not mathemattically connected to the original data 
    - Salting:
        - Adding extra characters to sensitive data before it is hashed
        - this means that two identical pieces of data will have different message digests because each has a unique salt 
        - common for password storage 
    - Hashing:
        - algorithms that represent data as a fixed length string of letters and numbers known as a message digest
        - Hashing is a one way algorithm meaning the original data cannot be deciphered from the message digest
        - The standard way to store passwords since even if the database is compromised the passwords won't be leaked only their hashes will be
- **Application Security**:
    - Input Validations:
        - Ensuring that data a user enters into an application is in the correct format 
        - this prevents attackers from injecting code in a place where data was supposed to be entered
    - Secure Cookies:
        - Cookies store information about a user on that users machine when they access a website
        - cookies don't necessarily contain sensitive data
        - its best practice to send cookies over HTTPS to do so securely 
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) headers:
        - HTTP headers can be configured to only allow a user to take certain actions 
        - commonly used to force ussers to communicate to a web server using HTTPS to provide encryption
    - Code Signing:
        - Code can be signed using the developers private key to create a digital signature 
        - this way the users OS can verify that the code is from that specific developer and that it remains unchanged 
    - Allow list:
        - Administrators can create a list of applications that users are allowed to access to prevent running anything but approved applications 
    - Block/deny list:
        - Admins can create a block list which would allow users to run any application they chose as long as the application is not on the list of prohibitted apps 
    - Secure Coding Practices:
        - Always important to validate and normalize user input 
        - always clear up unused memory 
        - always allocate the appropriate ammount of memory to store your variables 
    - Static Code analysis:
        - Static analyzers are software that can go through the code of an application and identify vulnerabilities that may exist 
    - Dynamic Code analyzers:
        - use techniques on a running application to find vulnerabilties that can be exploited by the end users 
    - Fuzzing:
        - Inputting various random data into an application to determine if any of the inputs will cause unexpected behavior 
- **Hardening**:
    - The act of making a system more secure 
    - Open Ports and Services:
        - Open ports and services that are unecissary create security risks 
        - it's best practice to audit all open ports and running services to determine if any of them are not needed 
    - Registry:
        - large data base containing the configurations for windows machines 
        - administrators can audit the registry to determine if any changes have been made to a system that makes it less secure 
    - Disk Encryption:
        - storage devices can be configured to be encrypted by default to prevent unauthorized access to the data they contain 
        - SEDs or self encrypting drives have this feature by default and are capable of entirely encrypting themselves and the data they contain 
    - OS:
        - Hardening often occurs at the OS level
        - this can include host based firewalls, premissions, password rules, and other configuration settings 
    - Patch management:
        - Its always important to keep software up to date to because patches and updates often contain fixes to vulnerabilities 
        - Third-party:
            - updates for software that is not developed by the same organization that makes the operating system
        - Auto-update:
            - some software including operating systems can be configured to automatically download and install updates as they come out
            - this can be good because it ensures security patches are quickly applied
            - this can be bad because some updates can affect functionality of sytems, meaning if they're not tested first an auto update can reduce the availibility of a system 
- **Self-encrypting drive (SED)/Full-disk encryption (FDE)**:
    - Self Encryptin Drive (SED):
        - Storage device built with the capability to automatically encrypt itself
        - can be erased with CE or cryptographic erase where you instruct the drive to remove the encryption key making all the data un readable 
    - Full-disk encryption(FDE):
        - The encryption of an entire storage device
        - OPAL:
            - software standard to preform full disk encryption on SEDs
- **Hardware root of trust**:
    - Trust for the software loaded on the operating system can begin on the hardware level
    - hardware components can store the signatures for OS software such as the kernel and boot loader
    - if a change is detected in any core component of the OS then the signatures won't match
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**:
    - Specific piece of hardware designed to hold cryptographic keys and preform algorithmic calculations for cryptography
    - Interfaces with UEFI during the boot process to verify the software 
    - part of the hardware root of trust 
- **Sandboxing**:
    - Isolated enviornment to run code in. 
    - can be used to analyze malware
    - can be used simply to isolate programs from one another 
### 3.3 given a scenario, implement secure network designs
- **Load Balancing**:
    - Active/active:
        - load is shared between two servers which both remain online at all times
    - Active/passive:
        - Load is sent to one server primarily the other remains offline unless the first server fails or the load requires more than the first can provide 
    - Scheduling:
        - the decision of which server traffic should be sent to when load balancing 
        - Round robin:
            - traffic is sent to each server in order sequentially
        - Weighted Round robin:
            - traffic is sent to servers sequentially but some servers may receive priority for example if they're more powerful 
        - Dynamic Round Robin:
            - traffic is sent sequentially unless a server has a ligther load than the others which will give it priority 
    - Virtual IP:
        - Load balancers are assigned a virtual IP that all inbound traffic is initally sent to 
        - this allows traffic from the outside to come into the load balancer as if it were going into one place, then it will be distributed among the actual IPs of servers by the load balancer 
    - Persistence:
        - A session needs to remain on the same server that it begins because the data is not yet shared between servers while the session is active
        - This requires Session affinity which means regardless of load balancing rules traffic over a session will continue to be sent to the server that the session began on to retain the back and forth conversation 
- **Network Segmentation**:
    - Virtual Local Area Network:
        - A logically seperated local area network
        - seperate broadcast domain meaning devices on the same VLAN can reach one another through broadcasts in the data link layer
        - allows for control over what devices are communicating with one another locally 
        - devices on a seperate VLAN will apear as if they're on a seperate local area network allowing for control between traffic between VLANs using firewalls 
    - Screened Subnet (previously known as DMZ):
        - A heavily protected subnet dedicated to providing access to an internal resource to the public internet 
        - an example may be a public facing web server 
        - the webserver will reside in the DMZ with strict firewall rules that allow internal updates to the webserver and also allow communication between the webserver and the public facing internet 
    - East-west traffic:
        - Traffic between devices in the same data center 
        - usually quick response times 
    - Extranet:
        - a segergated part of the network to allow external entities access to internal network resources 
        - commonly has additional authentication to access because it's not being accessed by the entire public internet like a DMZ would
        - common use if for third parties such as vendors to access specific internal resources 
    - Intranet:
        - Wide area network connecting resources that are internal to the organization
    - Zero Trust:
        - Assuming that all devices and data on the network are untrusted
        - meaning all network activity should be subject to security controls such as authentication and atestation 
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
    - Always-on:
        - A VPN that is configured to constantly be connected to the secure internal network 
        - commonly used on mobile devices to ensure that they're not accidentally connected to an insecure network while outside the organization
    - Split Tunnel vs Full tunnel:
        - Split tunnel:
            - Sends only the traffic intended for the internal network through the VPN concentrator while traffic intended for outside webservers is sent directly back and forth between the user and the webserer 
        - Full tunnel:
            - All traffic is sent through the VPN concentrator which will then send the traffic intended for external websites to those websites and will return the traffic to the user
    - Remote access vs Site-to-site
        - Remote access:
            - VPN used to connect from an external network into an internal network through a secure tunnel 
        - Site-to-site:
            - VPN used to connect from a secure internal network to a secure internal network at a different location 
    - IPsec:
        - VPN protocol to communicate through an encrypted tunnel
        - Uses AH or Authentication header to verify the integrity of the data 
        - Uses ESP or Encapsulating Security Payload to encrypt data and verify integrity 
        - Tunnel Mode: 
            - Wraps entire packet in IPsec headers and trailers then gives the packet a new IPsec header 
        - Transport Mode:
            - Wraps the data of a packet in IPsec header and trailer but leaves the original IP header in tact so that the data can be sent directly to its original destination 
    - SSL/TLS:
        - VPN operating over Secure Sockets layer or the more modern transport layer security protocol
        - TCP port 443 
        - doesn't require VPN client and is not typically blocked by external networks 
        - common to use authentication in a browser to provide remote access from a mobile device 
    - HTML5:
        - makes use of web cryptography API in HTML5 to create an SSL VPN directly from the users browser without the need for an additional VPN client
    - Layer 2 tunneling Protocol (L2TP):
        - Connecting 2 seperate networks together as if they're the same layer 2 network 
        - common for site-to-site vpns 
        - creates the encrypted tunnel but often combined with IPsec to provide the encryption using ESP
- **DNS**:
    - Domain Name System:
        - the system for translating the FQDN or fully qualified domain name like google.com to an actual IP address to route traffic to
        - we send querries to DNS servers which respond with the correct IP address for the given domain name 
    - DNS sec:
        - Sends the DNS query to the DNS server securely using encryption 
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**:
    - deciding what devices can and cannot connect to the network
    - Agent and agentless:
        - Agent:
            - Network Access control that requires a piece of software to be installed on the device attempting to access the network 
            - The agent preforms a health check known as a posture assessment on the device which is an asessement of the devices security to confirm it can connect to the network 
            - agent can be dissolvible meaning it is only installed on the device during the posture assessment and the uninstalled
            - agent can be persistent which mean the software remains on the device and can be remotely accessed to preform posture assesments 
        - Agentless:
            - an agent can be included on the operating system itself and would require no additional software to be installed 
- **Out-of-band management**:
    - Managing network interfaces through means not directly accessible from the network
    - commonly done through serial ports on network devices that provide a physical connection to the network infrastructure
- **Port Security**:
    - Broadcast Storm Prevention:
        - Broadcasts are sent out to all devices on the same broadcast domain
        - This can open the door for bad actors to flood the broadcast domain with traffic and creat a DOS 
        - to prevent this switches can be configured to limit the number of broadcasts that devices can send out
    - Loop Prevention:
          - A loop is when the paths between devices creates a circle on the network and traffic is sent in a circle endlessly 
          - Spanning tree protocol:
          - A protocol designed to analyze the topology of the network and strategically block ports to prevent a loop from occuring
          - can also provide fault tolerance if a network device is down STP can change which ports are blocked to enable routing of traffic 

    - Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard:
        - BPDU is the protocol that switches use in Spanning Tree to communicate with eachother, this is what allows STP to assess the network topology
        - Port fast was added to switches running STP to enable devices that aren't swtiches and that just need network connectivity to instantly connect to the network without being analyzed by the STP
        - BPDU guard prevents any device that communicates with BPDU frames from instantly sending packets with portfast 
        - it's assumed this device will be a switch and needs to be assessed by STP to prevent loops 
    - Dynamic Host Configuration Protcol (DHCP) snooping:
        - DHCP is the protocol used to assign local IP addresses to devices on the network 
        - DHCP snooping allows for the switch to trust certain DHCP servers to prevent unauthorized allocation of new local IP addresses using a rougue DHCP server 
    - Media Access Control (MAC) filtering:
        - Media Access Control Addresses are specific addresses that identify network hardware such as the NIC inside a users computer 
        - MAC filtering allows the switch to allow or dissallow traffic based on the MAC address it originates from 
        - The problem is MAC addresses are broadcast out in the broadcast domain and the MAC address of a computers NIC can be spoofed
        - this means that MAC filtering is not a strong security control because a bad actor can just spoof their MAC address and circumvent the filtering 
- **Network Applicances**:
    - Jump Servers:
       - A secure server accessible on the edge of the network used to 'jump' into the internal network and access internal network devices 
    - Proxy Servers:
        - Forward Proxy:
            - A proxy that takes internal network traffic and sends it to the external internet 
        - Reverse Proxy:
            - A proxy that takes inbound traffic from the external internet and sends it to the internal network 
    - Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)/Network-based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS):
        - NIDS:
            - Analyzes network traffic to warn of known vulnerabilities being exploited
            - often combined with NIPS
        - NIPS:
            - Inspects network traffic for known vulnerabilities being exploited then takes action to prevent this from occuring 
        - Signature based:
            - Identifies network intrusions using known vulnerability signatures 
        - Heuristic/Behavior:
            - Compares behaviors of network traffic with known base lines to determine if traffic is out of place and an attack is occuring 
        - Anomaly:
            - Network traffic that is drastically different than the normal baseline and is likely to be from an attak
        - Inline vs Passive:
            - Inline:
                - Inline NIDS/NIPS examine traffic as it is being sent through the network only allowing the traffic to flow if it is deemed safe 
            - Passive:
                - Passive IDS/IPS receive information from network devices that are directing traffic
                - the traffic is then analyzed and thus cannot be blocked in realtime 
    - HSM:
        - Hardware Security Module, a network appliance that preforms cryptographic functions, and can store encryption keys 
    - Sensors:
        - Network appliances that collect data from the network devices 
    - Collectors:
        - aggregate and parse the data from sensors 
        - can be specific to a certain network device such as the NIPS or NGFW 
    - Aggregators:
        - collects data from multiple sources such as collectors and device logs and combines it in one place
    - Firewalls:
        - Web Application Firewall (WAF):
            - Firewall used to control traffic to a public facing webserver 
            - can have more strict rules to prevent attacks from the public internet 
        - NGFW:
            - Firewall that allows or blocks traffic at OSI Layer 7, the application layer
            - can block or allow traffic from specific applications 
        - Stateful Firewall:
            - Firewall that is aware of the state of traffic 
            - this means that stateful firewalls can understand if traffic is coming as a response to previous traffic and automatically allow it through if the original traffic was already allowed
        - Stateless Firewall:
            - Not aware of the state of the traffic
            - Inspects every single packet regardless of it is a response to a previously allowed traffic flow
        - Unified Threat Management(UTM):
            - Firewall with more advanced security features
            - can inspect traffic for spam or malware
            - can preform URL filtering or content inspection 
        - Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway:
            - Allows multiple internal devices with different private IP addresses to communicate with the external Internet using the same public IP 
            - Can have additional security features sucha s traffic filtering 
        - Content/URL filtering:
            - pre-defined content and URLs that users are allowed or blocked from communicating with over the network 
            - common feature of many newer firewalls
        - Open-source vs proprietary:
            - Open Source firewall software has its code base publicly availible 
            - the advantage is that the code can be altered to suit your needs and the security of the code can be audited by anyone 
            - Propreitary firewall software is provided usually for a fee by a specific vendor, you cannot view the source code
            - the advantage is that the vendor will likely provide support for the firewall and keep the code updated to prevent vulnerablities 
            - the disadvantage is that you cannot audit the code yourself for vulnerabilities and you cannot customize the code to suit your needs 
        - Hardware vs Software:
            - Hardware Firewall:
                - A physical network device to preform firewall functions
                - you interface directly with the device to create firewall rules 
                - sensors, collectors and aggregators pull data/logs directly from this device 
            - Software Firewall:
                - Firewall defined in software to be added to another network device 
                - can be installed on an existing piece of hardware used to manage the network 
                - useful for cloud enviornments with a Software-defined network 
        - Appliance vs host-based vs virtual:
            - Firewall Appliance:
                - A physical piece of networking hardware to preform firewall functions  
                - needs to be installed and maintained 
            - Host-based firewall:
                - Firewall operating within the operating system of an endpoint 
                - can block or allow traffic only to/from that device specifically 
                - can be automatically configured when managing the device 
            - Virtual Firewall:
                - Firewall operating in a virtual enviornment such as a cloud 
                - can be controlled through Software-defined defined networking 
- **Access Control List (ACL)**:
    - A pre-defined list of traffic flows that are allowed or blocked on the network 
   - integral part of firewall configuration 
- **Route Security**:
    - Protecting the routing information that routers use to send traffic to the right places 
    - preventing maliciously crafted routes from directing traffic to an attacker 
    - BGP or border gateway protocol is what is used for routers to communicate routing information to one another BGPSEC introduces encryption and authentication to this protocol
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**:
    - Quality of service aims to provide the necessary network resources to services running on our network infrastructure 
    - Minimize down time and ensure services have enough resources to meet demand
    - Elasticity is the ability of network resources to scale up or down to meet the demand placed on it
    - Rapid Elasticity is the ability of a cloud system to scale its resources to meet demands in real time 
    - use methods such as load balancing to ensure uptime of servers 
    - applications transmitting VoIP or Video data may require more bandwith to reduce the latency and improve the quality of the audio or video stream 
- **Implications of IPv6**:
    - IPv6 was introduced after the adressing exhaustion of IPv4 meaning around 2010 we ran out of public IPv4 addresses
    - IPv6 has significantly more addresses, meaning each endpoint can receive its own IPv6 address which can be routed publicly this can eliminate the need for NAT which can have implications on network security controls such as ACLs 
    - IPv6 also eliminates broadcasts replacing ARP with Neighbor Discovery Protocol, this can eliminate ARP spoofing attacks where a device sends false ARP packets to pretend to have the MAC of another device 
- **Port Spanning/Port Mirroring**:
    - Through Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) the traffic going through one port of a network swtich can be copied and sent through a dedicated port to a security device such 
    - Port taps:
        - A device that splits the incoming port into two allowing a copy of the traffic to be analyzed
- **Monitoring Services**:
    - A paid service that monitors network traffic to look for anomalies and threats 
    - will often have professionals in a security operations center or SOC watching over traffic
    - can be a 24/7 service 
- **File integrity Monitors**:
    - can monitor files on devices that should not be changed such as system files
    - can be on each endpoint or integrated into IPS
### 3.4 Given a scenario, install and configure wireless security settings.
- **Cryptographic Protocols**:
    - WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2):
        - Older standard for cryptography 
        - Vulnerable to brute force of the Pre Shared Key
        - Attacker can listen to 4 way handshake and collect the hash of the PSK
    - WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3): 
        - Updated standard for wireless network cyrptography
        - does away with the four way handshake instead using Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) a key exchange simmilar to diffie helman to exchange the preshared key    
        - this eliminates the brute force attack on the PSK hash from WPA2
    - Counter-mode/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP):
        - cryptographic function used in WPA2 
        - Data is encrypted using AES or advanced encryption standard to encrypt data 
        - Uses CBC-MAC for the Message integrity check or MIC 
    - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE):
        - Key exchange process used in WPA3 
        - simmilar to diffie helman key exchange 
        - everyone authenticating is using a unique session key even if the Pre shared key is the same 
- **Authentication Protocols**:
    - Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP):
        - The standard framework for wireless authentication
        - integrates with 802.1X
    - IEEE 802.1X:
       - Port based Network Access Control (NAC)
       - REquires Authentication before accessing network
       - Connects with a database of credentials such as LDAP, RADIUS or TACACS+
       - The client to authenticate is known as a Supplicant which connects to an authenticator 
       - the authenticator communicates with an Authentication Server (AS) which has the database of credentials
    - Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP):
        - Encapsulates EAP framework in a TLS tunnel
        - Uses a digital certificate instead of a protected access credential (PAC) to establish this tunnel
        - certificate resides on the authentication server and not on the clients device  
    - EAP-FAST:
        - Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling
        - Authentication server and supplicant share a protected access credential (PAC) to authenticate to one another and set up a TLS tunnel
       - the users authentication credentials can then be sent to the AS over this TLS tunnel  
    - EAP TLS:
        - EAP process over a TLS tunnel 
        - the difference between this and FAST is that the supplicant requires the digital certificate as well as the AS in order for the tunnel to be established 
        - the downside is that you need to manage PKI on all devices since the cert can't just reside on the server 
    - EAP-TTLS:
       - EAP Tunneled Transport Layered Security
       - Support for other authentication protocols over a TLS tunnel such as MSCHAP or other EAP types
       - Like FAST the certificate to establish the TLS tunnel only resides on the AS 
    - Remote Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) Federation:
       - Members of an organization with a RADIUS authentication server can authenticate to a different organization's network using their RADIUS credentials 
       - Uses 802.1X, and EAP to authenticate
- **Methods**:
    - Pre-share key (PSK) vs Enterprise vs Open
        - Pre shared Key: 
            - Authentication to a wireless network using a known secret
            - this is like using the WiFi Password
            - anyone who knows this secret can connect to the network
        - Enterprise:
            - Authentication to a wireless network using enterprise credentials stored in an authentication server (AS)
            - examples of AS include: RADIUS, TACACS+, LDAP
        - Open:
            - An open Wireless network can be connected by anyone who can view the wireless SSID or network name
    - WiFi Protected Setup (WPS):
        - Allows various physical ways to authenticate to the network
        - examples include: NFC, a WPS button on the access point, a PIN Code
        - cryptographically flawed, the WPA pin is only 7 digits with the 8th being a checksum, meaning it takes few guesses to brute force 
        - Should be disabled for security 
    - Captive Portal:
        - Connecting to a wireless network with a captive portal will re-direct a new user to a webpage to create login credentials before they're provided with network access
        - commmon for public wifi networks such as those ina  coffee shop
- **Installation Considerations**:
    - Site Surveys:
        - mapping out where wireless access points will be installed 
        - based on factors such as interference, building material, other WAPs 
    - Heat Maps:
        - A map of all the wireless access points in an area
    - WiFi Analyzers:
        - Tools used to assess wireless network conditons
        - spectrum and packet analyzers can be used to create a heatmap of the WiFi signals during a site survey 
    - Channel Overlaps: 
        - wireless channels that overlap will create frequency conflicts and interupt connections 
        - 5GHz band has a large variety of connections
        - 2.4GHz has only 3 channels in north america
    - Wireless Access Point (WAP) Placement: 
        - Many considerations play into the placement of WAPs
        - Avoid overlap between other WAPs
        - avoid other electronic devices that might interfere with Radio frequency or electromagnetic frequency interference 
        - avoid thick materials
        - place WAPs as close as possible to where users will connect from 
    - Controller and access point security:
        - Controllers offer a centeral way to manage WAPs
        - can update firmware and view statistics
        - important to use HTTPS to communicate over encrypted channels when managing WAPs

        - can be blocked from installation or execution using MAM and MDM
    - Rooting/Jailbreaking:
        - Circumventing the security controls on a device to gain 'root' or privileged access 
        - can be dangerous because it undermines the security controls placed on a device by the MDM
    - Sideloading:
        - Installing applications from unofficial sources
        - these applications may not be vetted for security and pose a security risk
        - can be blocked from installation or execution using MAM and MDM
    - Carrier Unlocking:
        - Mobile devices are often locked to a cellular provider that subsidizes some of the devices cost, carrier unlocking circumvents this lock
        - can be done after the contract of the cellular provider is completed
        - can also be done without the provider's premission voiding the contract
        - can possibly circumvent MDM controls
    - Firmware over-the-air(OTA) updates:
        - a mobile devices firmware can be updated remotely through the MDM over the network 
        - this is known as an OTA upate
