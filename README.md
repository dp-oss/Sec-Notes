# Security+ 601 Study Notes

Thank you to **Professor Messer**. All notes are based on his free training course 
- Which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8

- this is not a comprehensive list of every video in his series, some of which I took notes for on paper
- I recommend cloning this repo to your machine and opening using Obsidian. Most of the linking throughout my notes is done with Obsidian syntax, I'm not sure if it will work with other Markdown editors such as logseq
    - Obsidian can be found here:
        https://obsidian.md/
- Please note that my notes are not intended to replace official Comptia study materials, I would reccomend taking your own notes on Messer's course and only using these for quick reference 
- the 601 is scheduled to retire July 31st of this year, keep this in mind when planning your studying as these might not be helpful if you plan on taking the exam beyond that date
- Please excuse my spelling and grammar I don't use spell check
- I reccomend checking out https://github.com/dp-oss/Sec-Notes/blob/main/Exam%20Objectives.md first for an overview of everything that will be on the exam

**Best of luck and happy studying :)**
