Computing based on quantum mechanics not on classical mechanics 

**Classical Mechanics**: 
- smallest information is a bit
- bits can be 0 or 1

**Quantum Mechanics**: 
- Smallest information is a qubit 
- Qubits can be anywhere between one and zero at all times 
	- known as a quantum superposition

32 qubits can represent over 4 billion values 

Can scan through enormous amount of data really quickly

Will impact various areas of computing greatly

**Post-Quantum [[Encryption and Cryptography|Cryptography]]**: 
Quantum computing will quickly break encryption based on large prime numbers because of the speed it can factor large primes 


**NTRU**: 
A cryptosystem using lattice theory 
- uses a closest vector problem instead of factoring primes 
- This makes it longer for quantum to break
- More Quantum resistant algorithms need to be made 

**Examining quantum bits changes them**: 
Quantum Key distribution (QKD) can be protected against eavesdropping because intercepting the key would change it and it would not work the same
