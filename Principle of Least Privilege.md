# Principle of Least Privilege
The idea that no user should be granted more access to a system than is required to complete necesary tasks. 

- Root / Admin accounts should only be used when their higher Privlege is required to complete a task
- regular users should be given the proper premissions to complete their tasks 
- premissions should be audited frequently
