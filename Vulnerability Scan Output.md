# Vulnerability Scan Output
Scanners look at large ammounts of data searching for signatures of vulnerabilities, learning to parse the output the scanner produces can be difficult 

- cross reference found vulnerabilities with online databases
    - National Vulnerability Database: 
        - http://nvd.nist.gov/
    - Microsoft Security Bulletins:
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/
- info is not definitive 
    - further research is needed 

## Scan Results 
- Lack of Security Controls
    - No firewall
    - no antivirus
    - no anti-spyware
- Misconfigurations
    - Open network sharing 
    - guest access
- Real vulnerabilities
    - Especially newer ones
    - sometimes odler

## False Positives 
A Vulnerability detected when there really is none 
- different than low severity
    - low severity is real but not high priority
    - false Positives are non existent 
- to minimize this update to the latest signatures
    - these are the most updated and accurate set
## False Negative
A Vulnerability exists but is not detected 
- can be a significant concern 
- to minimize this update to the latest signatures
    - these are the most updated and accurate set
