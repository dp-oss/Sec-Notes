Prepare to recover data in the event of disaster 

Prepare recovery site ahead of time 


**Hot Site**: Exact Duplicate of production hardware to be used in the event of a disaster
- constantly synced with production incase you need to switch
- an exact replica 
- makes it easier to move from production to recovery because its the same
- costs more

**Cold site**: Recovery site without hardware or data, or personnel
- everything needs to be brought in a disaster
- costs less

**Warm site**: Recovery site with some equipment but not all
- typically has hardware ready but not software or data 
- the more is ready for disaster the higher costs will be
