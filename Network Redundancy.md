**[[Load Balancing]]**: Networking equipment that decides which server is handling which requests. *balancing the load*
- some servers are active and some on standby
	- if an active one fails a passive one takes over


**NIC teaming (Network interface cards)**: using multiple cards to balance loads
- also known as Load Balancing / Fail Over (LBFO)
- aggregates bandwidth
- creates multiple paths incase one fails 
- Uses many network adapters
	- but they're made to look like a single adapter
- NICs communicate with one another and will failover if one doesn't respond
