- **Biometrics**: Methods that use something physical about your body to verify your identity
	- fingerprint
	- retina
	- Iris
	- Voice recognition
	- Facial Recognition
	- Gait analysis 
		- less common but analyzes Someone's walk
	- Veins and Blood vessels
	- **False acceptance rate (FAR)**
	- How often a biometric system approves the wrong users
	- can indicate if you need to increase sensitivity
	- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):**
	- how often legit users are rejected
	- can indicated if you need to decrease sensitivity
	- **Crossover Error rate (CER)**
	- Defines the overall accuracy
	- when FAR and FRR are Equal



- Very difficult to change 
- Not always foolproof
