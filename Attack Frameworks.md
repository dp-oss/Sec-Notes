# Attack Frameworks
Attacks and responses are a game of cat and mouse, Frameworks can help us understand the attacks and their risk 

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- MITRE corporation
- https://attack.mitre.org/
- methods used by attackers
- potential security techniques to block the attacks in the future

## Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
- designed by US intelligence community
- helps understand intrusions
- integrates well with other frameworks 
- apply scientific principles
    - measurement
    - testability 
    - repeatability
- 4 corners:
    1. Advesary
    2. Capability
    3. Victim
    4. Infrastructure
- Each corner is connected to another 
    - Advesary develops Capability
    - Capability exploits victim
    - victim connects to Infrastructure 
    - Advesary uses Infrastructure

## Cyber Kill Chain 
Seven phases of a cyber attack
1. Reconnaissance
    - gather intel 
2. Weaponization
    - Building exploit and payload
3. Delivery
    - sending the payload
4. Exploit
    - execute the maliscious code
5. Installation
    - malware is installed and victim is compromised
6. Command and Control
    - A C2 channel is created for remote access
7. Actions on Objectives
    - attacker carries out their Objectives
