A distributed ledger 

- Used for crypto 
- digital identification
- online voting



**The process**: 
- 1. The transaction
	- The transaction is added to the block chain and verified on all devices 
	- Once it's verified its added to a block of new transactions
	- A hash of the transaction is made to let everyone verify if somethings changed
- 2. Once the block is complete it is added to the ledger and distributed to all devices on the ledger 
Attempting to change verified information will cause your block to be rejected and not added to the distributed ledger
