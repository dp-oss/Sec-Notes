**Edge Computing:** Running applications locally processing the data where it originates not in the cloud
- often used for IOT devices 
- no latency, no network requirement

**Fog Computing:** Cloud computing that is distributed, allowing data to be processed locally or closer to its origin, but later sent to the cloud for additional processing
- cloud + IOT 
- immediate data stays local while other is sent to cloud/data centers 
- reduces latency but allows for additional processing in the cloud
- **nodes**: local cloud computers that can act as a midpoint for processing before data is sent off to the cloud
