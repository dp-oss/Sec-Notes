Edge vs access control
- edge is your link to the internet 
- managed through [[Firewalls]]

Access control is not necessarily only to those connected to the network 
- just determines who is allowed on the network 


**Can't trust all endpoints**: 
- many companies have BYOD (bring your own device)

**Posture assessment**: checking the health of a device before it is added to the netowrk
- is it trusted 
- antivirus? 
- corporate applications 
- is it mobile 
- is it encrypted 
- all devices should be checked before connecting to the network 
- failure to meet the requirements means the device will be quarentined and cannot join the network 

**Persistent agents**: software installed on endpoints that preforms health checks  


**Dissolvable agents**
- installation not required 
- runs during the posture assessment and removes after 

**Agentless NAC**: integrated with active directory 
- checks are made during log in or log off
