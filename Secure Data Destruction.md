- Legality may influence your ability to destroy certain data


- Critical information needs to be destroyed physically 
	- prevents dumpster diving 


## Sanitization 
**A NOTE ON THIS SECTION:** 
*It seems the videos definition of purging and Wiping may differ from industry or government standards, as I do not have detailed information about specific exam objectives I am unsure whether or not this inconsistency is an error in the video or in the exam definitions. NIST Special Publication 800-88 Guidelines for media Sanitization outline 3 types of Sanitization: 
    1. Clear applies logical techniques to sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations
	for protection against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques
    1. Purge applies physical or logical techniques that render Target Data recovery infeasible
	using state of the art laboratory techniques. 
    1. Destroy renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory
	techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data*

Storage media can be **sanitized** to be reused for other purposes 
- **Purging** is removing some of the data 
- **Wiping**  is writing over the data not just deleting to ensure it is gone for good 

Always secure garbage with a fence and lock
- keep on property if possible 

Shred documents
- burn if really sensitive 

Pulp the paper 
- put into large tank washing of ink
	- recycle into new paper 


Shredders/Pulverizes can be used on hard disks 
- a drill to the platter works too 
- ensure complete destruction
Electromagnets can *degauss* hard disks 
Incinerators used too 


If destruction is done by a third party documentation of destruction must be provided
