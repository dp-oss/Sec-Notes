**5G**: The fifth gen of broadband cellular networking 
 - allows iot devices to transfer more data and faster 

**Subscriber Identity Module (SIM):** Card that provides information to cell network allowing connections
- often contain IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) 
- this verifies who you are allowing you to connect 
- many embedded systems use SIM cards

**Narrowband**: Communication of analog signals over a very small range of frequencies
- allows for longer range than broadband 

**Baseband:** Communication over a single frequency
- typically over fiber or copper wire 
- since there is only one frequency it can only be used 0% or 100% on each wire 
- includes ethernet standards 

**Zigbee**: A standard for IoT devices to connect to networks 
- longer range the bluetooth
- less power consumed than WiFi
- Allows devices to *mesh* meaning signals can hop from one zigbee device to another to communicate with server 
- Uses ISM band 900Mhz to 2.4 GHz
