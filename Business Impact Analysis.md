# Business Impact Analysis

## Recovery 
- Recovery time Objective (RTO)
    - the time it will take to get back up and running
- Recover point Objective (RPO)
    - the minimum requirements to consider a system back up and running 
- Mean time to repair (MTTR)
    - how long will it take to fix issue
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
    - time between outages

## Functional revoery Plans
Plan to recover from an outage
- a step by step guide
- contact information
- technical process to resolve the problem
    - knowledge base
    - internal processes
- recover and test 
    - confirm systems work normally 

## Removing single points of failure
- identify and remove single points that can bring the system down
- network
    - multiple devices
    - see: [[Network Redundancy]]
- facility/utilities
    - backup power
        - see: [[Redundancy#power-redundancy]]
    - hvac
- People/location
- redundancy is expensive
- see [[Redundancy|redundancy]]
## Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Detailed plan for resuming operations after disaster
- plan extensively prior to disaster
- backups
- off-site data
- cloud alternatives
- remote sites
- Third parties offer recovery servicces 

## Impact
- Life is the most important
    - we dont want anyone to die
- Property
    - buildings and assests
- Safety
    - enviornments need to be safe to work in
- finance
    - cost
- Reputation
    - loss of status or trust

## Mission Essential Functions
Most important functions to your operations
- this is where your analysis starts
- what technical resources are required for these functions

## Site risk assessment
All locations are different
- recovery plan should be unique to each enviornment
